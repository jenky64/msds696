Here, the Oklahoma failed to do so. By declaring the noncompetition agreements in two employment s null and rather than leaving that to the in the first instance, the state court ignored a basic tenet of the Act's substantive law. The decision must be vacated. This dispute arises from a between petitioner Nitro-Lift Technologies, L.L.C. and two of its former employees.

The court dismissed the complaint, finding that the s contained valid s under which an and not the court, must the parties' disagreement. The Oklahoma retained respondents' and ordered the parties to show cause why the matter should not be resolved by application of Oklahoma , A (West ), which limits the enforceability of noncompetition agreements.

The Oklahoma acknowledged the cases on which Nitro-Lift relied, as well as their relevant holdings, but chose to discount these controlling decisions. Its conclusion that, despite this Court's jurisprudence, the underlying 's validity is purely a matter of state law for state-court is all the more reason for this Court to assert The Oklahoma 's decision disregards this Court's precedents on the FAA.

case-574-21,unknown," Over days in April Joshua Frost helped two associates commit a series of armed robberies in the State of Washington. In the main, Frost drove his confederates to and from their crimes. On one occasion, he also entered the house being robbed. On another, he performed surveillance in anticipation of the Washington charged Frost with and related offenses. Taking the stand, Frost admitted to his involvement, but claimed he acted under As closing arguments drew near, however, Frost's lawyer expressed the desire to contend both that the State failed to meet its burden of proving that Frost was an to the crimes and that Frost acted under The insisted that the defense choose between these alternative arguments, explaining that state law prohibited a from simultaneously contesting the elements of the crime and presenting the affirmative defense of So Frost's lawyer limited his summation to The convicted Frost of six counts of one count of attempted one count of and two counts of The Washington sustained Frost's It rejected the court's view that state law prohibited Frost from simultaneously contesting criminal and arguing By preventing the defense from presenting both theories during summation, it said, the court violated the National Constitution's Due Process and Assistance of s. But the State continued, this improper of closing argument qualified as a error (a mistake reviewable for harmlessness) rather than a structural error (a mistake that requires automatic reversal). Because the heard three taped confessions and Frost's of guilt on the stand, and because it received proper instructions on the State's burden of proof, the State held that any error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Frost filed a petition for of habeas under28 U.S.C. The District Court dismissed the petition, appendix to petition for of a, and a of the Court of Appeals affirmed, Frost versus an Boening, Federal (CA9 ). But the Court of Appeals en banc reversed and instructed the District Court to grant relief. Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Act of (AEDPA), the Court of Appeals had power to grant Frost habeas only if the Washington 's decision QUOTED TEXT or QUOTED TEXT28 U.S.C. Here, the Ninth held that the Washington unreasonably applied clearly established federal law by failing to classify the court's of closing argument as structural error. That decision cannot stand. Assuming for argument's sake that the court violated the Constitution, it was not clearly established that its mistake ranked as structural error. Most constitutional mistakes call for reversal only if the government cannot demonstrate harmlessness. Only the rare type of error in general, one that QUOTED TEXT and QUOTED TEXT requires automatic reversal. None of our cases clearly requires placing improper of closing argument in this narrow category. The Ninth claimed that the Washington contradicted Herring versus New York, U.S. ). Herring held that complete denial of summation violates the Assistance of According to the Ninth Herring further held that this denial amounts to structural error. We need not opine on the accuracy of that interpretation. For even assuming that Herring established that complete denial of summation amounts to structural error, it did not clearly establish that the of summation also amounts to structural error. A court could reasonably conclude, after all, that prohibiting all argument differs from prohibiting argument in the alternative. That is all the more true because our structural-error cases QUOTED TEXT Neder, at n. Attempting to bridge the gap between Herring and this case, the Ninth cited two s United States versus Miguel, Federal (CA9 ), and Conde versus Henry, Federal (CA9 for the proposition that QUOTED TEXT Federal d, at As we have repeatedly emphasized, however, does not constitute QUOTED TEXT ); see, e.g., Lopez versus Smith, U.S. (per curiam) (slip opinion, at ). The Ninth acknowledged this rule, but tried to get past it by claiming that could QUOTED TEXT Federal d, at n. But neither Miguel nor Conde arose under AEDPA, so neither purports to reflect the law clearly established by this Court's holdings. The Ninth thus had no for relying on those decisions. See Parker versus Matthews, U.S. (per curiam) (slip opinion, at ). The second rationale for the Court of Appeals' decision is no more sound than the first. The Ninth reasoned that, by allowing the to argue that it had proved the elements of the crimes, but QUOTED TEXT the defense from responding that it had not, the court in effect QUOTED TEXT Federal d, at By extracting this QUOTED TEXT the Ninth continued, the court QUOTED TEXT QUOTED TEXT and even QUOTED TEXT all QUOTED TEXT Id., at Number The court, to begin, did not prohibit the defense from arguing that the failed to prove the elements of the crime. It instead precluded the defense from simultaneously contesting reasonable doubt and claiming Reasonable minds could disagree whether requiring the defense to choose between alternative theories amounts to requiring the defense to concede guilt. Still more could they disagree whether it amounts to eliminating the 's burden of proof, shifting the burden to the or directing a In addition, even if the court's ruling somehow QUOTED TEXT the defense QUOTED TEXT id., at the Ninth still would have no basis for ruling as it did. It goes much too far to suggest that our cases clearly establish that this supposed extraction of a QUOTED TEXT is structural error, when they classify the introduction of a coerced confession only as error, Arizona versus Fulminante, U.S. ). Frost argued below that, even if it was reasonable for the State to treat improper of summation as error, it was unreasonable for it to find harmlessness on the facts of this case. The Court of Appeals did not address this argument when sitting en banc, and it is not before us today. We grant the petition for a of and 's motion to proceed in forma pauperis. We reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth and the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

Kulbicki then filed a petition for post- relief, which lingered in state court until when Kulbicki added a that his defense s were ineffective for failing to question the legitimacy of CBLA. By then, years after his CBLA had fallen out of favor. Indeed, Kulbicki supplemented his petition once more in after the Court of Appeals of Maryland held for the first time that CBLA evidence was not generally accepted by the scientific community and was therefore inadmissible. See Clemons versus State, Maryland , A. ). Kulbicki lost in the lower state courts and appealed to the Court of Appeals of Maryland. At that point, Kulbicki abandoned his of ineffective assistance with respect to the CBLA evidence, but the high court vacated Kulbicki's on that ground alone. Kulbicki's according to the court, should have found a report coauthored by Peele in that QUOTED TEXT Maryland, at A. d, at One of the many findings of the report was that the composition of lead in some bullets was the same as that of lead in other bullets packaged many months later in a separate box. Rather than conduct QUOTED TEXT the authors QUOTED TEXT that coincidence (or, in one case, the likelihood that separately packaged bullets originated from the same source of lead) caused the overlap. The Court of Appeals opined that this lone finding should have caused the report's authors to doubt QUOTED TEXT the faulty assumption that ultimately led the court to reject CBLA evidence years later. see Clemons, A. d, at The authors' QUOTED TEXT the Court of Appeals concluded, was QUOTED TEXT Maryland, at A. d, at In the Court of Appeals' view, any good should have spotted this methodological flaw.

That is especially the case here, since there is no reason to believe that a diligent search would even have discovered the supposedly crucial report. The Court of Appeals offered a single in support of its sweeping statement that the report QUOTED TEXT to Kulbicki's in -a Government Printing Office Web page accessed by the Court of Appeals, apparently conducting its own Internet research nearly two decades after the Id., at and n.

And then, would effective really have brought to the attention of the a report whose conclusion was that CBLA was a valid investigative technique in cases just like Kulbicki's?

As part of Barkes's intake, a nurse who worked for the or providing healthcare at the Institution conducted a medical evaluation. The evaluation included a mental health screening designed in part to assess whether an inmate was suicidal. The nurse employed a screening form based on a model form developed by the National Commission on Correctional Health Care (NCCHC) in The form listed risk factors. If the inmate's responses and nurse's observations indicated that at least eight were present, or if certain serious risk factors were present, the nurse would notify a physician and initiate prevention measures. Barkes disclosed that he had a history of psychiatric treatment and was on medication. He also disclosed that he had attempted in though not as far as the record indicates that he had also done so on three other occasions. And he indicated that he was not currently thinking about killing himself. Because only two risk factors were apparent, the nurse gave Barkes a QUOTED TEXT referral to mental health services and did not initiate any special prevention measures. Barkes was placed in a cell by himself. Despite what he had told the nurse, that evening he called his wife and told her that he QUOTED TEXT and was going to kill himself. Barkes's wife did not inform anyone at the Institution of this call. The next morning, correctional officers observed Barkes awake and behaving normally at and a.m. At a.m., however, an officer arrived to deliver lunch and discovered that Barkes had hanged himself with a sheet. Barkes's wife and children, respondents here, brought under Review U.S.C. against various entities and individuals connected with the Institution, who they ed had violated Barkes's civil rights in failing to prevent his At issue here is a against petitioners Stanley Taylor, Commissioner of the Delaware Department of Correction and Raphael Williams, the Institution's warden. Although it is undisputed that neither petitioner had personally interacted with Barkes or knew of his condition before his death, respondents alleged that Taylor and Williams had violated Barkes's constitutional right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment. They did so, according to respondents, by failing to supervise and monitor the private or that provided the medical treatment including the intake screening at the Institution. Petitioners moved for summary judgment on the ground that they were entitled to qualified immunity, but the District Court denied the motion. A divided of the Court of Appeals for the Third affirmed. The majority first determined that respondents had alleged a cognizable theory of supervisory (a decision upon which we express no view). The majority then turned to the two-step qualified immunity inquiry, asking QUOTED TEXT Id., at Taking these questions in reverse the Third held that it was clearly established at the time of Barkes's death that an incarcerated individual had an Eighth Amendment QUOTED TEXT Id., at The majority then concluded there were material factual disputes about whether petitioners had violated this right by failing to adequately supervise the or providing medical services at the prison.

There was also evidence that the or did not have access to Barkes's records (which would have shed light on his mental health history), and that the or had been short-staffing to increase profits.

The Third nonetheless found this right clearly established by two of its own decisions, both stemming from the same case. Assuming for the sake of argument that a right can be QUOTED TEXT by despite disagreement in the courts of appeals, neither of the Third decisions relied upon clearly established the right at issue. The first, Colburn I, said that if officials QUOTED TEXT they have an obligation QUOTED TEXT Colburn versus Upper Darby Twp., Federal ). The decision did not say, however, that detention facilities must implement procedures to identify such vulnerable inmates, let alone specify what procedures would suffice. And the Third later acknowledged that Colburn I 's use of the phrase QUOTED TEXT which might seem to nod toward a screening requirement of some kind was erroneous in light of Farmer versus Brennan, U.S. which held that Eighth Amendment requires actual awareness of risk. See Serafin versus Johnstown, Federal ppendix (CA3 ). Nor would Colburnhave put petitioners on notice of any possible constitutional violation. Colburnreiterated that officials who know of an inmate's particular vulnerability to must not be recklessly indifferent to that vulnerability.

In response to the Seventh 's opinion, the State filed a petition for rehearing and rehearing en banc. The State's petition argued that the Seventh had erred by granting relief in the absence of a federal violation. It also contended, on the authority of our opinion in Wainwright versus Goode, U.S. (per curiam), that the Court of Appeals erred by second-guessing the Indiana 's factual that its own court complied with Indiana law. The Seventh denied rehearing, but amended its opinion to include this language: QUOTED TEXT appendix to petition for of a a. The amendment did not cure the defect. It is not enough to note that a habeas petitioner asserts the existence of a constitutional violation; unless the federal court agrees with that assertion, it may not grant relief. The Seventh 's opinion reflects no such agreement, nor does it even articulate what federal right was allegedly infringed. In fact, as to one possible federal the court maintains that it would not violate federal law for Indiana to adopt a rule authorizing what the court did. In lieu of finding or even describing a constitutional error, the amended opinion says only that the State had not QUOTED TEXT appendix to petition for of a. It is not clear what this language was meant to It cannot have meant that the State forfeited the position that 's allegations do not state a constitutional violation, since (as we observed) the State explicitly disputed that point before the District Court the last forum in which the subject had been raised, leading the Court of Appeals to conclude that had waived the entirely.

We disagree. The context presented in the instant case which involves a civil SBM proceeding is readily distinguishable from that presented in [United States v.] Jones, where the Court considered the propriety of a search in the context of a motion to suppress evidence. We conclude, therefore, that the specific holding in [United States v.] Jones does not control in the case ."" The court in Grady's case held itself bound by this reasoning and rejected his Fourth Amendment challenge. appendix to petition for of a a. The North Carolina in turn summarily dismissed Grady's and denied his petition for discretionary review. Grady now asks us to reverse these decisions. The only explanation provided below for the rejection of Grady's challenge is the quoted passage from State versus Jones. And the only theory we discern in that passage is that the State's system of nonconsensual satellite-based monitoring does not entail a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. That theory is inconsistent with this Court's precedents. In United States versus Jones, we held that ""the Government's installation of a GPS device on a target's vehicle, and its use of that device to monitor the vehicle's movements, constitutes a 'search.' U.S. at (slip opinion, at omitted). We stressed the importance of the fact that the Government had ""physically occupied private for the purpose of obtaining information."" Under such circumstances, it was not necessary to inquire about the target's expectation of privacy in his vehicle's movements in to determine if a Fourth Amendment search had occurred. ""Where, as here, the Government obtains information by physically intruding on a constitutionally protected area, such a search has undoubtedly occurred."" We reaffirmed this principle in Florida versus Jardines, U.S. (slip opinion, at ), where we held that having a drug-sniffing dog nose around a suspect's front porch was a search, because police had ""gathered information by physically entering and occupying the [curtilage of the house] to engage in conduct not explicitly or implicitly permitted by the homeowner."" See also id., at (slip opinion, at (a search occurs ""when the government gains evidence by physically intruding on constitutionally protected areas""). In light of these decisions, it follows that a State also conducts a search when it attaches a device to a person's body, without for the purpose of tracking that individual's movements. In concluding otherwise, the North Carolina Court of Appeals apparently placed decisive weight on the fact that the State's monitoring program is civil in nature. See Jones, N.C. Application, at S.E. d, at (""the instant case involves a civil SBM proceeding""). ""It is well settled,"" however, ""that the Fourth Amendment's protection extends beyond the sphere of criminal investigations,"" Ontario versus Quon, U.S. and the government's purpose in collecting information does not control whether the method of collection constitutes a search. A building inspector who enters a home simply to ensure compliance with civil safety regulations has undoubtedly conducted a search under the Fourth Amendment. See Camara versus Municipal Court of City and County of San Francisco, U.S. (housing inspections are ""administrative searches"" that must comply with the Fourth Amendment). In its in opposition to the State faults Grady for failing to introduce ""evidence about the State's implementation of the SBM program or what information, if any, it currently obtains through the monitoring process."" Without evidence that it is acting to obtain information, the State argues, ""there is no basis upon which this Court can determine whether North Carolina conducts a 'search' of an offender enrolled in its SBM program."" (citing Jones, U.S. at n. (slip opinion, at n. (noting that a government intrusion is not a search unless ""done to obtain information"")). In other words, the State argues that we cannot be sure its program for satellite-based monitoring of sex offenders collects any information. If the very name of the program does not suffice to rebut this contention, the text of the surely does: ""The satellite-based monitoring program shall use a system that provides all of the following: ) Time-correlated and continuous tracking of the geographic location of the subject ) Reporting of subject's violations of prescriptive and proscriptive schedule or location requirements."" The State's program is plainly designed to obtain information. And since it does so by physically intruding on a subject's body, it effects a Fourth Amendment search. That conclusion, however, does not decide the ultimate question of the program's constitutionality. The Fourth Amendment prohibits only unreasonable searches. The reasonableness of a search depends on the totality of the circumstances, including the nature and purpose of the search and the extent to which the search intrudes upon reasonable privacy expectations. See, e.g., Samson versus California, U.S. (suspicionless search of parolee was reasonable); ernonia School District versus Acton, U.S. (random drug testing of student athletes was reasonable). The North Carolina courts did not examine whether the State's monitoring program is reasonable when properly viewed as a search and we will not do so in the first instance. The petition for is granted, the judgment of the of North Carolina is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. It is so ed. Notes Grady aims his petition at the decisions of both North Carolina appellate courts. See Petition for Because we treat the North Carolina 's dismissal of an for lack of a substantial constitutional question as a decision on the merits, it is that court's judgment, rather than the judgment of the Court of Appeals, that is subject to our review under U.S.C.

case-577-15-648,unknown,"A Georgia court entered a final judgment of making petitioner ersus L. a legal parent of the children that she and E.L. had raised together from birth. ersus L. and E.L. later separated while living in Alabama. ersus L. asked the Alabama courts to enforce the Georgia judgment and grant her custody or visitation rights. The Alabama ruled against her, holding that the Full Faith and Credit of the United States Constitution does not require the Alabama courts to respect the Georgia judgment. That judgment of the Alabama is now reversed by this summary disposition L. and E.L. are two women who were in a relationship from approximately until Through assisted reproductive technology, E.L. gave birth to a child named S.L. in and to twins named N.L. and H.L. in After the children were born, ersus L. and E.L. raised them together as joint parents. ersus L. and E.L. eventually decided to give legal to the relationship between ersus L. and the children by having ersus L. formally adopt them. To facilitate the the couple rented a house in Alpharetta, Georgia. ersus L. then filed an petition in the Superior Court of Fulton County, Georgia. E.L. also appeared in that proceeding. While not relinquishing her own parental rights, she gave her express to ersus L.'s of the children as a second parent. The Georgia court determined that ersus L. had complied with the applicable requirements of Georgia law, and entered a final of allowing ersus L. to adopt the children and recognizing both ersus L. and E.L. as their legal parents. ersus L. and E.L. ended their relationship in while living in Alabama, and ersus L. moved out of the house that the couple had shared. ersus L. later filed a petition in the Court of Jefferson County, Alabama, alleging that E.L. had denied her access to the children and interfered with her ability to exercise her parental rights. She asked the Alabama court to register the Georgia judgment and award her some measure of custody or visitation rights. The matter was transferred to the Family Court of Jefferson County. That court entered an awarding ersus L. scheduled visitation with the children. E.L. appealed the visitation to the Alabama Court of Civil Appeals. She argued, among other points, that the Alabama courts should not recognize the Georgia judgment because the Georgia court lacked subject-matter to enter it. The Court of Civil Appeals rejected that argument. It held, however, that the Alabama family court had erred by failing to conduct an evidentiary hearing before awarding ersus L. visitation rights, and so it remanded for the family court to conduct that hearing. The Alabama reversed. It held that the Georgia court had no subject-matter under Georgia law to enter a judgment allowing ersus L. to adopt the children while still recognizing E.L. 's parental rights. As a consequence, the Alabama held Alabama courts were not required to accord full faith and credit to the Georgia judgment. The Constitution provides that QUOTED TEXT U.S. Constitution,Article . That requires each State to recognize and give effect to valid judgments rendered by the courts of its sister States. It serves QUOTED TEXT Milwaukee County versus M.E. White Co., U.S. ).With respect to judgments, QUOTED TEXT Baker versus General Motors Corp., U.S. ).

QUOTED TEXT Milliken, at (quoting Adam versus Saenger, U.S. )).Those principles resolve this case. That provision on its face gave the Georgia Superior Court subject-matter to hear and decide the petition at issue here.

Whatever the merits of that judgment, it was within the statutory grant of over QUOTED TEXT Ibid. The Georgia court thus had the QUOTED TEXT required to entitle its judgment to full faith and credit. Baker, at .The Alabama reached a different result by relying on Georgia Code Annotation That states (as relevant here) that QUOTED TEXT The Alabama concluded that this provision prohibited the Georgia Superior Court from allowing ersus L. to adopt the children while also allowing E.L. to keep her existing parental rights. It further concluded that this provision went not to the merits but to the Georgia court's subject-matter In reaching that crucial second conclusion, the Alabama seems to have relied solely on the fact that the right to under Georgia law is purely statutory, and QUOTED TEXT appendix to petition for of a a (quoting In re Marks, Georgia Application , S.E. )).That analysis is not consistent with this Court's controlling Where a judgment indicates on its face that it was rendered by a court of competent such QUOTED TEXT Milliken, at (quoting Adam, at ). There is nothing here to rebut that presumption. The Georgia on which the Alabama relied, Georgia Code Annotation does not speak in al terms; for instance, it does not say that a Georgia court QUOTED TEXT only if each existing parent or has surrendered his or her parental rights. Neither the Georgia nor any Georgia appellate court, moreover, has construed as al. That construction would also be difficult to reconcile with Georgia law. Georgia recognizes that in general, subject-matter addresses QUOTED TEXT Goodrum versus Goodrum, Georgia S.E. ), not whether a court should grant relief in any given case. Unlike which expressly gives Georgia QUOTED TEXT does not speak to whether a court has the power to decide a general class of cases.

case-565-520,unknown," James Lambert was convicted and sentenced to death in for the murder of two patrons during a of Prince's Lounge in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. One of the Commonwealth's primary es at Lambert's was Bernard Jackson, who admitted to being involved in the and identified Bruce Reese and Lambert as his accomplices. Almost years later, Lambert brought a for postconviction relief in Pennsylvania state court, alleging that the Commonwealth had failed to disclose, inter alia, a QUOTED TEXT in violation of Brady versus Maryland, U.S. This document, dated October , noted that a photo display containing a picture of an individual named Lawrence Woodlock was shown to two es to the Prince's Lounge but that QUOTED TEXT Exhibit Application to in Opposition. The document further noted that QUOTED TEXT by Jackson, who was in custody at the time on several charges and had admitted to involvement in at least armed robberies of bars. The activity sheet did not indicate whether Jackson's reference was to the Prince's Lounge crime or one of the others. The sheet bore the names of the law enforcement officers involved in the investigation of the Prince's Lounge It also bore the names of the 's murder victims, as well as the police case numbers for those murders. The Commonwealth has identified no evidence that Woodlock was ever investigated for any other or that his photo was shown to a in any other Lambert ed that the activity sheet was exculpatory, because it suggested that someone other than or in addition to him, Jackson, and Reese was involved in the Prince's Lounge crime. Lambert also argued that he could have used the activity sheet to impeach Jackson's at because the statement attributed to Jackson suggested that Jackson had identified Woodlock as a participant prior to identifying Lambert. The Commonwealth countered that the asserted QUOTED TEXT by Jackson reflected in the activity sheet was in fact nothing more than an QUOTED TEXT Ibid. The Commonwealth argued that this notation simply indicated that Jackson had named Woodlock as a QUOTED TEXT in some incident, without specifying whether Woodlock was said to be involved in the Prince's Lounge or one of the dozen other robberies in which Jackson had admitted participating. In this regard, the Commonwealth noted that Woodlock's name was not mentioned anywhere else in the police records, proceedings, or Jackson's statements about the Prince's Lounge As the Commonwealth has put it, QUOTED TEXT Reply to in Opposition The Commonwealth QUOTED TEXT that the document would not have advanced any impeachment of Jackson, because he had already been extensively impeached at Thus, according to the Commonwealth, the QUOTED TEXT would not have discredited Jackson any further. The Pennsylvania agreed with the Commonwealth and unanimously rejected Lambert's Brady holding that the disputed document was not material. The court concluded that there was no reasonable probability that the result of Lambert's would have been different had the document been disclosed. See Strickler versus Greene, U.S. Calling Lambert's that the reference to Woodlock QUOTED TEXT meant someone else was involved in the Prince's Lounge QUOTED TEXT the court noted that QUOTED TEXT Pennsylvania, at A. d, at QUOTED TEXT the court continued, the document QUOTED TEXT Ibid. Lambert filed a petition for a of habeas in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania under U.S.C. ing, inter alia, that the Commonwealth's failure to disclose the document violated his rights under Brady. The District Court denied the holding that the state courts' that the notations QUOTED TEXT was QUOTED TEXT Lambert versus Beard, Civil Number (July ), appendix to petition for of . The court explained that QUOTED TEXT Id., at On however, the Court of Appeals for the Third reversed and granted the The Third concluded that it was QUOTED TEXT for the Pennsylvania to presume that whenever a is impeached in one manner, any other impeachment evidence would be immaterial. According to the Third the notation that Jackson had identified Woodlock as a QUOTED TEXT would have QUOTED TEXT because the at had relied on the fact that Jackson had consistently named Lambert as the third participant in the The Commonwealth petitioned for The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Act of (AEDPA) precludes a federal court from granting a of habeas to a state prisoner unless the state court's adjudication of his QUOTED TEXT U.S.C. ). In this case, however, the Third overlooked the of the state courts that the notations were, as the District Court put it, QUOTED TEXT but instead QUOTED TEXT appendix to petition for of . Instead, the Third focused solely on the alternative ground that any impeachment value that might have been obtained from the notations would have been cumulative. If the conclusion in the state courts about the content of the document was reasonable not necessarily correct, but reasonable whatever those courts had to say about cumulative impeachment evidence would be beside the point. The failure of the Third even to address the QUOTED TEXT nature of the notations, and the QUOTED TEXT nature of Lambert's reading of them, is especially surprising, given that this was the basis of the District Court ruling. The Court of Appeals ordered that Lambert, convicted of capital murder nearly years ago, be set free unless the Commonwealth retried him within days. It did so because of a police activity sheet noting that Jackson had identified Woodlock as a QUOTED TEXT and bearing other information associating the sheet with the Prince's Lounge The Court of Appeals, however, failed to address the state court ruling that the reference to Woodlock was ambiguous and any connection to the Prince's Lounge speculative. That ruling on which we do not now opine may well be reasonable, given that the activity sheet did not explicitly link Woodlock to the Prince's Lounge Jackson had committed a dozen other such robberies, Jackson was being held on several charges when the activity sheet was prepared, Woodlock's name appeared nowhere else in the Prince's Lounge files, and the two es from the Prince's Lounge who were shown Woodlock's photo did not identify him as involved in that crime. Any re here would take place three decades after the crime, posing the most daunting difficulties for the That burden should not be imposed unless each ground supporting the state court decision is examined and found to be unreasonable under AEDPA. The petition for and 's motion to proceed in forma pauperis are granted. The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Third is vacated, and the case is remanded for proceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered. The dissent emphasizes that the activity sheet was prepared for the investigation into the Prince's Lounge crime. No one disputes that. The ambiguity at issue concerns whether Jackson's statement referred to that crime, or one of his many others. The dissent also finds QUOTED TEXT that the state courts believed Jackson's reference to Woodlock QUOTED TEXT Post, at The Pennsylvania however, recognized the Commonwealth's argument that Jackson could have named Woodlock as a codefendant in some other and concluded that QUOTED TEXT Commonwealth versus Lambert, Pennsylvania , A. ).

case-578-15-723,unknown," In the fall of Michigan law enforcement received an anonymous tip that two white males were traveling on I between Detroit and Grand Rapids in a white Audi, possibly carrying cocaine. Officers spotted a vehicle matching that description and pulled it over for speeding. Timothy Etherton was driving; Ryan Pollie was in the passenger seat. A search of the car uncovered grams of cocaine in a compartment at the bottom of the driver side door. Both Etherton and Pollie were ed. Etherton was tried in state court on a single count of with intent to deliver cocaine. At the facts reflected in the tip were not contested. The central point of contention was instead whether the cocaine belonged to Etherton or Pollie. Pollie testified for the pursuant to a agreement. He ed that he had accompanied Etherton from Grand Rapids to Detroit, not knowing that Etherton intended to obtain cocaine there. According to Pollie, once the pair arrived in Detroit, Etherton left him alone at a restaurant and drove off, returning some minutes later. It was only after they were headed back to Grand Rapids that Etherton revealed he had obtained the drugs. The also called several police officers to Three of the officers described the content of the anonymous tip leading to Etherton's On the third recounting of the tip, Etherton's objected on hearsay grounds, but the objection was not resolved when the agreed to move on. At closing, the also described the tip. The court instructed the that QUOTED TEXT but was admitted QUOTED TEXT appendix to petition for of a. The convicted Etherton, and his was affirmed on direct The Michigan denied leave to Etherton sought post relief in state court on six grounds. Three are relevant here: First, he ed that the of the anonymous tip violated his rights under the Confrontation of the Sixth Amendment. Second, that his was ineffective for failing to object to the tip on that ground. And third, that his on direct was ineffective for failing to raise the Confrontation and the ineffective assistance of s. The state habeas court rejected the first two s on procedural grounds and the third on the merits. To prevail on a for ineffective assistance of appellate the state court explained, Etherton had to demonstrate that QUOTED TEXT appendix to petition for of a a. The state court concluded that Etherton failed on both counts. First, the court reasoned, appellate may have reasonably forgone any Confrontation after concluding that 's failure to object was the product not of ineffectiveness but of strategy. While Etherton's current argues that should have objected because the tip's reference to QUOTED TEXT suggested involvement by Etherton from the outset, in Opposition the reference also suggested Pollie's prior involvement, contrary to his that he was not with Etherton when he picked up the cocaine and had nothing to do with it. As the state court explained, not objecting would have been consistent with 's QUOTED TEXT appendix to petition for of a. Second, the court determined, Etherton had not been prejudiced by 's choice: there was QUOTED TEXT of his guilt and QUOTED TEXT of the case. Etherton's allegations, the court concluded, ultimately failed to overcome the presumption that his appellate functioned reasonably in not pursuing the Confrontation or ineffectiveness s. Both the Michigan Court of Appeals and the Michigan denied leave to Etherton next sought federal habeas relief. Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Act of (AEDPA), federal habeas relief was available to him only if the state court's decision QUOTED TEXT U.S.C. ). QUOTED TEXT Harrington versus Richter, U.S. (quoting Yarborough versus Alvarado, U.S. ). The state court decision must be QUOTED TEXT White versus Woodall, U.S. (slip opinion, at (internal quotation marks omitted).

In such circumstances, federal courts are to afford QUOTED TEXT Burt, at (slip opinion, at ). The District Court denied relief, but the Court of Appeals for the Sixth reversed in relevant part, over the dissent of Kethledge. The majority concluded that Etherton's appellate had been constitutionally ineffective, and that no fairminded jurist could conclude otherwise. Without ruling on the merits of the court's holding that had been ineffective, we disagree with the that no fairminded jurist could reach a contrary conclusion, and reverse. In finding ineffective, the majority first concluded that Etherton's right to confrontation had been violated. The Confrontation prohibits an out-of-court statement only if it is admitted for its truth. The Sixth determined that the contents of the tip were admitted for their truth because the tip was referenced by three different witnesses and mentioned in closing argument. These QUOTED TEXT the majority below concluded, QUOTED TEXT Federal d, at The majority next found that Etherton had been prejudiced by the violation, a showing Etherton's state court would have had to make on to obtain relief either on the forfeited Confrontation objection, see People versus Carines, Michigan N.W. (showing of prejudice required to overcome ), or the ineffectiveness Strickland, at (showing of prejudice required to demonstrate ineffective assistance of ). In finding prejudice, the majority acknowledged the evidence of Etherton's guilt: the cocaine was found in a driver side compartment inches from Etherton; he owned the car; and he was driving at the time of But, according to the majority, that evidence was not enough to convict Etherton absent Pollie's And that is where the tip came in. QUOTED TEXT the Sixth stated, QUOTED TEXT Federal d, at In reaching these conclusions, the Sixth did not apply the appropriate standard of review under AEDPA. A QUOTED TEXT could conclude that repetition of the tip did not establish that the uncontested facts it conveyed were submitted for their truth. Such a jurist might reach that conclusion by placing weight on the fact that the truth of the facts was not disputed. No of this Court clearly forecloses that view. It is also not beyond the realm of possibility that a fairminded jurist could conclude that Etherton was not prejudiced when the tip and Pollie's corresponded on uncontested facts. After all, Pollie himself was privy to all the information contained in the tip. A reasonable might regard the fact that the tip and Pollie's corresponded to be unremarkable and not pertinent to Pollie's credibility. (In fact, the only point of Pollie's actually reflected in the tip was that he and Etherton were traveling between Detroit and Grand Rapids.) Etherton's underlying complaint is that his appellate lawyer's ineffectiveness meant he had QUOTED TEXT in Opposition But it would not be objectively unreasonable for a fairminded to conclude especially in light of the deference afforded under Strickland that the failure to raise such a was not due to incompetence but because the facts in the tip were uncontested and in any event consistent with Etherton's defense. See Harrington, U.S. at (QUOTED TEXT). A fairminded jurist could similarly conclude, again deferring under Strickland, that appellate was not incompetent in drawing the same conclusion. And to reach the final point at issue before the Sixth a fairminded jurist applying the deference due the state court under AEDPA could certainly conclude that the court was not objectively unreasonable in deciding that appellate was not incompetent under Strickland, when she determined that was not incompetent under Strickland. Given AEDPA, both Etherton's appellate and the state habeas court were to be afforded the benefit of the doubt.

case-578-15-789,unknown," Federal habeas courts generally refuse to hear s QUOTED TEXT Coleman versus Thompson, U.S. State rules count as QUOTED TEXT if they are QUOTED TEXT Walker versus Martin, U.S. (internal quotation marks omitted). Like all States, California requires criminal s to raise available s on direct Under the so-called QUOTED TEXT a procedurally s a raised for the first time on state review if he could have raised it earlier on direct See In re Dixon, California , P. ). Yet, in this case, the Ninth held that the Dixon bar is inadequate to bar federal habeas review. Because California's procedural bar is longstanding, oftcited, and shared by habeas courts across the Nation, this Court now summarily reverses the Ninth 's judgment. I Donna Kay Lee and her boyfriend Paul Carasi stabbed to death Carasi's mother and his ex-girlfriend. A California convicted the pair of two counts each of first-degree murder. Carasi received a death and Lee received a of life without the possibility of In June Lee unsuccessfully raised four s on direct After the California appellate courts affirmed, Lee skipped state postconviction review and filed the federal habeas petition at issue. See U.S.C. The petition raised mostly new s that Lee failed to raise on direct Because Lee had not exhausted available state-court remedies, however, the District Court temporarily stayed federal proceedings to allow Lee to pursue her new s in a state habeas petition. The California denied Lee's petition in a summary citing Dixon. Having exhausted state remedies, Lee returned to federal court to litigate her federal habeas petition. The District Court dismissed her new s as procedurally ed. Then, for the first time on Lee challenged the Dixon bar's adequacy. In her Lee presented a small sample of the California 's state habeas denials on a single day about six months after her Lee ed that out of the summary denials on December , the court failed to cite Dixon in cases where it should have been applied. The court instead denied the nine petitions without any at all. In Lee's view, these missing s proved that the California courts inconsistently applied the Dixon bar. Without evaluating this evidence, the Ninth reversed and ed QUOTED TEXT Lee versus Jacquez, Federal ppendix ). On the warden submitted a study analyzing more than summary habeas denials during a nearly -year period around the time of Lee's procedural From August to June the study showed, the California cited Dixon in approximately of all denials more than times. In light of this evidence, the District Court held that the Dixon bar is adequate. The Ninth again reversed. Lee's -day sample proved the Dixon bar's inadequacy, the court held, because the QUOTED TEXT Federal d, at The general rate proved nothing, the court reasoned, because the warden QUOTED TEXT Id., at Inthe Ninth 's view, without this QUOTED TEXT the warden's -year study was QUOTED TEXT to prove Dixon's adequacy. Federal d, at .The Ninth 's decision profoundly misapprehends what makes a state procedural bar QUOTED TEXT That question is a matter of federal law. Lee versus Kemna, U.S. QUOTED TEXT capable of barring federal habeas review, QUOTED TEXT Martin, at (quoting Beard versus Kindler, U.S. ). California's Dixon bar satisfies both adequacy criteria. It is QUOTED TEXT because, decades before Lee's June procedural the California warned s in plain terms that, absent QUOTED TEXT habeas QUOTED TEXT Dixon, at P. d, at And the California eliminated any arguable ambiguity surrounding this bar by reaffirming Dixon in two cases decided before Lee's See In re Harris, California th n. P. , n. ); The California 's repeated Dixon s also prove that the bar is QUOTED TEXT Martin recently held that another California procedural bar a rule requiring prisoners to file state habeas petitions promptly met that requirement because QUOTED TEXT the timeliness rule. The same goes for Dixon. Nine purportedly missing Dixon s from Lee's -day sample of summary s hardly support an inference of inconsistency. See Dugger versus Adams, U.S. n. (holding that the Florida applied its similar procedural bar QUOTED TEXT despite QUOTED TEXT). Indeed, all nine s in that sample were denials. None ignored the Dixon bar to grant relief, so there is no sign of inconsistency. Nor is California's rule unique. Federal and state habeas courts across the country follow the same rule as Dixon. QUOTED TEXT It appears that every State shares this procedural bar in some form. See for State of Alabama and others as Amici Curiae n. (collecting s). For such well-established and ubiquitous rules, it takes more than a few outliers to show inadequacy. Federal habeas courts must not lightly QUOTED TEXT Kindler, U.S. at And it would be QUOTED TEXT Ibid. Nothing suggests, moreover, that California courts apply the Dixon bar in a way that disfavors federal s. The Court therefore holds that it qualifies as adequate to bar federal habeas review. The Ninth 's contrary reasoning is unpersuasive and inconsistent with this Court's precedents. Applying the Dixon bar may be a QUOTED TEXT or QUOTED TEXT task for state courts. But simplicity does not imply that missing s reflect state-court inconsistency. To begin with, since the Dixon bar has several exceptions, see Robbins, at and n. P. d, at and n. the California can hardly be faulted for failing to cite Dixon whenever a petitioner raises a that he could have raised on direct More importantly, California courts need not address procedural before reaching the merits, so the purportedly missing s show nothing. Compare Bell versus Cone, U.S. n. per curiam) (declining to address the warden's procedural- argument); Lambrix versus Singletary, U.S. (explaining that QUOTED TEXT bypassing a procedural- question if the merits QUOTED TEXT). Ordinarily, QUOTED TEXT Trest versus Cain, U.S. As a result, the appropriate of analysis for each case remains within the state courts' discretion. Such discretion will often lead to QUOTED TEXT Martin, U.S. at and n. But that superficial tension does not make a procedural bar inadequate. QUOTED TEXT Id., at see Kindler, at The Ninth 's attempt to get around Martin and Kindler fails. The Court of Appeals distinguished those cases on the ground that California's Dixon bar is QUOTED TEXT rather than discretionary because it involves a discretion-free general rule, notwithstanding exceptions that might involve discretion. The Court assumes, without deciding, that this description is accurate and the Dixon bar's exceptions leave some room for discretion. Even so, there is little difference between discretion exercised through an otherwise adequate procedural bar's exceptions and discretion that is a part of the bar itself. In any event, the Ninth 's reasoning ignores the state courts' discretion to assume, without deciding, that a is not procedurally ed and instead hold that the lacks merit. The Ninth was wrong to dismiss the -plus summary denials citing Dixon simply because they do not reveal which cases potentially implicate the bar. Martin already rejected this precise reasoning. There, the habeas petitioner unsuccessfully argued that QUOTED TEXT U.S. at (internal quotation marks omitted). By treating every missing as a sign of inconsistency, the Court of Appeals QUOTED TEXT for California. The court forced the State to choose between the QUOTED TEXT and a burdensome opinion- ing requirement. see Martin, at (noting that the California QUOTED TEXT); Harrington versus Richter, U.S. (discussing the advantages of summary dispositions). The Ninth 's decision is thus fundamentally at odds with the QUOTED TEXT Kindler, at QUOTED TEXT Here, the Ninth permitted California prisoners to evade a well-established procedural bar that is adequate to bar federal habeas review.

Clay filed a petition for a of habeas in State Superior Court. That court denied Clay's petition, as did the California Court of The California denied review. Clay subsequently filed a federal petition for a of habeas which the District Court granted. The District Court concluded that the Governor's reliance on the nature of Clay's long-past commitment offense violated Clay's right to due process, and dismissed each of the other factors the Governor cited as unsupported by the record. The Ninth affirmed, agreeing with the District Court's conclusion that QUOTED TEXT Clay versus Kane, Federal ppendix ).In granting habeas relief based on its conclusion that the state courts had misapplied California's QUOTED TEXT rule, the Ninth must have assumed either that federal habeas relief is available for an error of state law, or that correct application of the State's QUOTED TEXT standard is required by the federal Due Process Neither assumption is correct. As to the first: The habeas QUOTED TEXT Wilson versus Corcoran, U.S. (per curiam) (slip opinion, at (quoting U.S.C. ). Estelle versus McGuire, U.S. (quoting Lewis versus Jeffers, U.S. )). As for the Due Process standard analysis under that provision proceeds in two steps: We first ask whether there exists a liberty or interest of which a person has been deprived, and if so we ask whether the procedures followed by the State were constitutionally sufficient. Here, the Ninth held that California law creates a liberty interest in see Federal d, at While we have no need to review that holding here, it is a reasonable application of our cases. See Board of Pardons versus Allen, U.S. ); Whatever liberty interest exists is, of course, a state interest created by California law. There is no right under the Federal Constitution to be conditionally released before the expiration of a valid and the States are under no to to their prisoners. When, however, a State creates a liberty interest, the Due Process requires fair procedures for its vindication and federal courts will review the application of those constitutionally required procedures. In the context of we have held that the procedures required are minimal. In Greenholtz, we found that a prisoner subject to a similar to California's received adequate process when he was allowed an opportunity to be heard and was provided a statement of the reasons why was denied. we held, QUOTED TEXT Ibid. Cooke and Clay received at least this amount of process: They were allowed to speak at their hearings and to contest the evidence against them, were afforded access to their records in advance, and were notified as to the reasons why was denied. Federal d, at appendix to petition for of a a; California Penal Code Annotation (West Supplement ). That should have been the beginning and the end of the federal habeas courts' inquiry into whether Cooke and Clay received due process. Instead, however, the Court of s reviewed the state courts' decisions on the merits and concluded that they had unreasonably de ined the facts in light of the evidence. See Federal d, at Federal ppendix, at Other Ninth cases have done the same. See, e.g., Pearson versus Muntz, Federal ). No opinion of ours supports converting California's QUOTED TEXT rule into a substantive federal requirement. The liberty interest at issue here is the interest in when the California standards for have been met, and the minimum procedures adequate for due-process protection of that interest are those set forth in Greenholtz. See Hayward versus Marshall, Federal (CA9 (en banc). Greenholtz did not inquire into whether the constitutionally requisite procedures provided by Nebraska produced the result that the evidence required; a fortiori it is no federal concern here whether California's QUOTED TEXT rule of judicial review (a procedure beyond what the Constitution demands) was correctly applied. It will not do to pronounce California's QUOTED TEXT rule to be QUOTED TEXT of the liberty interest, Federal d, at Such reasoning would subject to federal-court merits review the application of all state-prescribed procedures in cases involving liberty or interests, including (of course) those in criminal prosecutions. That has never been the law. To the contrary, we have long recognized that QUOTED TEXT Engle versus Isaac, U.S. , n. ); see also Estelle, U.S. at Because the only federal right at issue is procedural, the relevant inquiry is what process Cooke and Clay received, not whether the state court decided the case correctly. The Ninth 's questionable finding that there was no evidence in the record supporting the denials is irrelevant unless there is a federal right at stake, as requires. See id., at The short of the matter is that the responsibility for assuring that the constitutionally adequate procedures governing California's system are properly applied rests with California courts, and is no part of the Ninth 's business. The petition for a of and respondents' motions for leave to proceed in forma pauperis are granted. The judgments below are Reversed. Cooke and Clay argue that the greater protections afforded to the of good-time credits should apply, citing In re Rosenkrantz, California th P. ), a California case that refers to our good-time-credits decision in Superintendent, Massachusetts Correctional Institution at Walpole versus Hill, U.S. ). But Rosenkrantz did not purport to equate California's system with good-time credits. It cites Hill twice. The first merely observes that the court relied upon Hill in an earlier opinion adopting the QUOTED TEXT test for decisions to that had previously been granted. The second which does occur in the part of the opinion discussing the need for QUOTED TEXT review in decisions, simply borrows language from Hill to support the proposition that QUOTED TEXT can QUOTED TEXT California th, at P. d, at (quoting Hill, U.S. at ). In any event, the question of which due process requirements apply is one of federal law, not California law; and neither of these s comes close to addressing that question. Any doubt on that score is resolved by a subsequent stating that the court's decision is premised only on state law.",9913,1587,65,24.05,15.05,479,42.6,510,"I,that,the,of,If,the,the,in,a,The,that,In,In,A,of,in,and,a,to,of,to,in,with,the,of,In,the,that,yet,for,its,on,the,of,his,to,for,of,his,to,in,his,to,and,of,while,in,The,that,a,but,it,the,as,because,it,several,and,a,for,a,of,in,The,his,it,at,a,with,the,of,and,a,for,by,the,Both,In,a,to,the,The,his,The,that,a,by,the,and,that,a,of,that,It,that,the,under,by,any,at,all,that,a,to,if,of,in,and,a,to,for,to,with,the,of,In,the,for,but,the,his,to,the,and,for,The,the,of,his,which,to,for,of,his,to,in,and,his,for,and,after,the,the,that,to,to,his,for,and,of,a,of,a,for,a,of,in,That,as,the,of,The,a,for,a,of,which,the,The,that,the,on,the,of,past,to,and,each,of,the,other,the,as,by,the,The,with,the,that,on,its,that,the,the,either,that,for,of,or,that,of,the,by,the,Neither,As,to,the,The,per,at,As,for,the,under,that,in,We,whether,a,or,of,which,a,and,if,so,we,whether,the,by,the,the,that,a,in,at,While,we,no,to,that,it,a,of,our,of,Whatever,of,a,by,no,under,the,to,before,the,of,a,and,the,under,no,to,to,their,When,however,a,a,the,for,its,and,the,of,those,In,the,of,we,that,the,In,we,that,a,to,a,to,when,he,to,and,a,of,the,we,and,at,this,of,They,to,at,their,and,to,the,against,to,their,in,and,as,to,the,at,to,for,of,That,the,and,the,of,the,into,whether,and,however,the,of,the,on,the,and,that,they,the,in,of,the,at,at,Other,the,No,of,into,a,The,at,the,in,when,the,for,and,the,for,of,that,those,in,into,whether,the,by,the,that,the,a,it,no,whether,of,a,beyond,what,the,It,to,to,of,the,at,to,the,of,all,in,or,of,those,in,That,the,To,the,we,that,at,Because,the,at,the,what,and,whether,the,the,The,that,no,in,the,the,unless,a,at,as,i,at,The,of,the,that,the,for,that,the,with,and,no,of,the,The,for,a,of,and,for,to,in,The,below,and,that,the,to,the,of,In,a,that,to,our,in,at,But,to,with,It,The,that,the,upon,in,the,for,to,that,The,which,in,the,of,the,the,for,in,from,to,the,that,at,at,at,In,any,the,of,which,one,of,and,neither,of,these,to,that,Any,on,that,by,a,that,the,on",0,0.0,78,4.91,"habeas corpus,citation,certiorari,parole,property,offer,Respondent,revocation,duty,receiving,revoke,writ,Clause,Supreme Court,determination,statute,misconduct,sentence,corpus,term,Appeal,Circuit,Court of Appeal",77.64,0.84,8.73,3,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,3,1,1,3,7,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,103,32,1,1,0,6,0,4,0,0,7,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,3,1,1,3,2,0,2,1,0,0,0,38,0,0,2,0,27,0,0,2,19,0,0,0,0,8,39,5,0,1,2,9,3,0,0,0,10,0,0,3,0,0,1,0,0,1,7,0,2,50,0,1,2,1,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,3,6,0,0,0,0,1,0,36,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,23,2,4.975
case-566-650,unknown," Lorenzo Johnson was convicted as an and co-conspirator in the murder of Taraja Williams, who was killed by a shotgun blast to the chest in the early morning hours of December , in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. After his was affirmed in state court, Johnson exhausted his state remedies and sought a of habeas in Federal District Court pursuant to the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Act of (AEDPA), U.S.C. The District Court denied habeas relief but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third reversed, holding that the evidence at was insufficient to support Johnson's under the standard set forth in Jackson versus irginia, U.S. We have made clear that Jackson claims face a high bar in federal habeas proceedings because they are subject to two layers of judicial deference. (quoting Renico versus Lett, U.S. (slip opinion, at )). Because the Court of Appeals failed to afford due respect to the role of the and the state courts of Pennsylvania, we now grant and reverse the judgment below. The parties agree that Williams was shot and killed by Corey Walker, who was subsequently convicted of first-degree murder. Johnson was with Walker on the night of the crime, and the two were tried jointly. Johnson was charged as an and co-conspirator. See Pennsylvania Constitutional (defining first-degree murder as QUOTED TEXT killing); (imposing for anyone who, QUOTED TEXT); Commonwealth versus Montalvo, Pennsylvania , A. (criminal for anyone who takes an in furtherance of a crime he has agreed to abet or commit). At the Commonwealth called ictoria Doubs, who testified that she, Johnson, and Walker were QUOTED TEXT who QUOTED TEXT Tr. On the morning of December the three of them awoke at the same residence, bought marijuana, and then went to a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant, where they encountered Williams. Walker announced that he was going to QUOTED TEXT Williams about a Williams owed. According to Doubs, Walker and Williams QUOTED TEXT with Walker QUOTED TEXT Id., at Williams was QUOTED TEXT Id., at A fight ensued, which ended when Williams beat Walker with a broomstick in front of the crowd of people that had gathered. After the fight, Doubs testified, Walker QUOTED TEXT Johnson was present when Walker made these statements. Later that afternoon, Doubs recounted the beating to others, who laughed at Walker. Once again, Johnson was present for these statements. Another was Carla Brown, a friend of the victim, who testified that she was at the Midnight Special Bar on the night of December where she saw Walker, Johnson, and Williams engaged in a heated argument. Although she could not hear what they were saying, she could tell they were arguing because they were making QUOTED TEXT Id., at The bouncer soon told them to leave, and Brown followed them into the street because she QUOTED TEXT Ibid. Brown observed the three men walking in a single-file line, with Walker in front, Williams in the middle, and Johnson in the back. Walker was wearing a long leather coat, walking as if he had something concealed underneath it. Brown followed the three men to an alleyway, at which point Williams recognized Brown and told her to QUOTED TEXT and pass. Walker then entered the alleyway, followed by Williams, while Johnson remained standing at the entrance. As Brown walked past the alley, she heard a loud QUOTED TEXT causing her to run away. On cross-examination, Brown stated: QUOTED TEXT Ibid. The Commonwealth also called Aaron Dews, who testified that he was in a building ing the alleyway at a.m. on the morning of December He heard a loud boom that caused him to look out into the alley from his second-story window, where he saw two silhouettes fleeing. After Dews the Commonwealth called Brian Ramsey, who had been selling cocaine on a nearby street corner at the time of the murder. He testified that he saw Williams walking toward an alleyway with two males and a female, and he heard a loud boom shortly after Williams entered the alley. When pressed on cross-examination, he stated: QUOTED TEXT Id., at The also heard from police who searched the alley shortly after the murder and found a shotgun with the barrel missing. A medical examiner who examined Williams' body testified that the cause of death was a shotgun wound to the chest. After the convicted Johnson, he filed a post- motion arguing that the evidence was insufficient to support his The court denied his motion, and the Pennsylvania Superior Court affirmed the on direct See Commonwealth versus Johnson, A. ). After the Pennsylvania denied his petition for review, Johnson unsuccessfully sought state post relief. He then filed a habeas petition in Federal District Court, which denied his claims. See Johnson versus Mechling, Federal Supplement (MD Pennsylvania ). Finally, Johnson ed to the Third which reversed the District Court and ed his overturned. Under Jackson, evidence is sufficient to support a if, QUOTED TEXT U.S. at In light of the at Johnson's the Court of Appeals acknowledged that QUOTED TEXT Johnson versus Mechling, Federal ppendix (CA3 ). As for the notion that QUOTED TEXT however, the court concluded that was QUOTED TEXT that no rational factfinder could accept as true. The court stated that QUOTED TEXT Id., at (quoting Commonwealth versus McFarland, Pennsylvania , A. )). In for a 's inferences to be permissible, the court reasoned, they must QUOTED TEXT that are QUOTED TEXT Federal ppendix, at (quoting Commonwealth versus Bostick, A. (Pennsylvania Super. )). At the outset, we note that it was error for the Court of Appeals to look to Pennsylvania law in determining what distinguishes a reasoned inference from QUOTED TEXT Under Jackson, federal courts must look to state law for QUOTED TEXT U.S. at n. but the minimum amount of evidence that the Due Process requires to prove the offense is purely a matter of federal law. Under the deferential federal standard, the approach taken by the Court of Appeals was flawed because it unduly impinged on the 's role as factfinder. Jackson leaves juries broad discretion in deciding what inferences to draw from the evidence presented at requiring only that jurors QUOTED TEXT Id., at This deferential standard does not permit the type of fine-grained factual parsing in which the Court of Appeals engaged. For example, in addressing Brown and Ramsey's that Williams was QUOTED TEXT and QUOTED TEXT into the alleyway, the court objected that the es did not describe any QUOTED TEXT supporting the conclusion that force was used. Absent some specific that QUOTED TEXT ibid., the court could see no reasonable basis for the 's conclusion that Johnson had a specific intent to help kill Williams. That analysis is flawed for two reasons. First, the coercive nature of Johnson and Walker's behavior could be inferred from other circumstances not involving the direct use of force: Walker was noticeably concealing a weapon, and he had been heatedly threatening to kill Williams after a violent confrontation earlier in the day. Johnson and Walker kept Williams between them in a single-file line on the way to the alley, where Johnson stood at the entrance while the other two entered, suggesting that Johnson may have been prepared to prevent Williams from fleeing. And second, even if Williams was not coerced into the alley, the still could have concluded that Johnson helped lead or lure him there to facilitate the murder. Taken in the light most favorable to the the revealed that Johnson and Walker QUOTED TEXT and had attempted to collect a from Williams earlier on the day of the murder. Williams resisted the collection, managing to humiliate Walker in the process by giving him a public thrashing with a broomstick. This enraged Walker to the point that he repeatedly declared over the course of the day in Johnson's presence that he intended to kill Williams. Then, while Walker was noticeably concealing a bulky object under his trenchcoat, Johnson helped escort Williams into an alley, where Johnson stood at the entryway while Walker pulled out a shotgun and shot Williams in the chest. On the basis of these facts, a rational could infer that Johnson knew that Walker was armed with a shotgun; knew that he intended to kill Williams; and helped usher Williams into the alleyway to meet his fate. The in this case was convinced, and the only question under Jackson is whether that finding was so insupportable as to fall below the threshold of bare rationality. The state court of last review did not think so, and that in turn is entitled to considerable deference under AEDPA, U.S.C. Affording due respect to the role of the and the state courts, we conclude that the evidence at Johnson's was not nearly sparse enough to sustain a due process challenge under Jackson. The evidence was sufficient to convict Johnson as an and a co-conspirator in the murder of Taraja Williams. The Commonwealth's petition for and the motion to proceed in forma pauperis are granted, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Third is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

See Williams versus Taylor, U.S. Knowles versus Mirzayance, U.S. As indicated above, the parties here dispute whether two principles of law are clearly established under this framework. One is whether, after a 's valid waiver of his right to under Faretta, a post- preappeal motion for a new is a critical stage of the For purposes of analysis here, it will be assumed, without so holding, that it is. The other disputed question is whether, after a 's valid waiver of a has discretion to deny the 's later request for reappointment of In resolving this question in 's favor, the Court of s first concluded (correctly) that QUOTED TEXT once he has validly waived it. Federal d, at (internal quotation marks omitted). It then (also correctly) recognized that the lack of a decision on nearly identical facts does not by itself mean that there is no clearly established federal law, since QUOTED TEXT from this Court's cases can supply such law. The Court of s erred, however, in its application of this latter proposition to the controlling issues here. It is beyond dispute that QUOTED TEXT Iowa versus Tovar, U.S. ); see United States versus Cronic, U.S. ); It is just as well settled, however, that a also has the right to QUOTED TEXT Faretta, U.S. at There can be some tension in these two principles. As the Faretta Court observed, QUOTED TEXT Id., at California has resolved this tension by adopting the framework under review. Under that approach, s are afforded discretion when considering postwaiver requests for their decisions on such requests must be based on the totality of the circumstances, QUOTED TEXT Lawley, at P. d, at (quoting People versus Windham, California , P. ); final alteration in original).

It has adopted a QUOTED TEXT Federal d, at (quoting Robinson versus Ignacio, Federal (CA9 ); emphasis deleted), as well as a rule that, QUOTED TEXT id., at (quoting Menefield, Federal d, at emphasis deleted). It is unnecessary for present purposes to the merits of these two approaches or determine what rule the Sixth Amendment in fact establishes for postwaiver requests of appointment of All this case requires and all the Court of s was empowered to do under is to observe that, in light of the tension between the Sixth Amendment's of QUOTED TEXT Tovar, at and its concurrent promise of QUOTED TEXT Faretta, at it cannot be said that California's approach is contrary to or an unreasonable application of the QUOTED TEXT established by the Court's assistance-of- cases. The Court of s' contrary conclusion rested in part on the mistaken belief that may be used to refine or sharpen a general principle of jurisprudence into a specific legal rule that this Court has not announced. Parker versus Matthews, U.S. (per curiam) (slip opinion, at (QUOTED TEXT); see Federal d, at . The error in this approach is subtle, yet substantial. Although an appellate may, in accordance with its usual law-of-the- procedures, look to to ascertain whether it has already held that the particular point in issue is clearly established by see, e.g., Tolliver versus Sheets, Federal , n. (CA6 (QUOTED TEXT); versus McDaniel, Federal (CA9 ), it may not canvass decisions to determine whether a particular rule of law is so widely accepted among the Federal s that it would, if presented to this Court, be accepted as correct. See Parker, at (slip opinion, at ); The Court of s failed to abide by that limitation here. Its resulting holding was erroneous and must be reversed.

case-567-758,unknown," Plaintiffs in this case that West irginia's congressional redistricting plan violates the QUOTED TEXT principle that we have held to be embodied in Article I, of the United States Constitution. A three- District Court for the Southern District of West irginia agreed, declaring the plan QUOTED TEXT and enjoining West irginia's Secretary of State from implementing it. The state defendants ed directly to this Court. See U.S.C. Because the District Court misapplied the standard for evaluating such challenges set out in Karcher versus Daggett, U.S. and failed to afford appropriate deference to West irginia's reasonable exercise of its political judgment, we reverse. Article I, of the United States Constitution requires that Members of the House of Representatives QUOTED TEXT and QUOTED TEXT In Wesberry versus Sanders, U.S. we held that these commands require that QUOTED TEXT Id., at We have since explained that the QUOTED TEXT standard does not require that congressional districts be drawn with QUOTED TEXT but instead that the State justify population differences between districts that could have been avoided by QUOTED TEXT Karcher, at (quoting Kirkpatrick versus Preisler, U.S. ); internal quotation marks omitted). Karcher set out a two-prong test to determine whether a State's congressional redistricting plan meets this standard. First, the parties challenging the plan bear the burden of proving the existence of population differences that QUOTED TEXT U.S. at If they do so, the burden shifts to the State to QUOTED TEXT that the population differences QUOTED TEXT Id., at . This burden is a QUOTED TEXT one, which QUOTED TEXT Id., at As we recently reaffirmed, redistricting QUOTED TEXT Perry versus Perez, U.S. (per curiam) (slip opinion, at ). In this case, plaintiffs that West irginia's redistricting plan, adopted following the decennial United States census, violates Article I, of the United States Constitution and, separately, the West irginia Constitution. The census did not alter West irginia's allocation of three congressional seats. But due to population shifts within the State, West irginia nonetheless began redistricting to comply with the requirements in our s. In August the West irginia Legislature convened an extraordinary session, and the State Senate formed a -member Select Committee on Redistricting. The committee first considered a redistricting plan championed by its chair, Majority Leader John Unger, and dubbed QUOTED TEXT because it achieved a population difference of a single person between the largest and smallest districts. That appears, however, to have been the only perfect aspect of the Perfect Plan. State legislators expressed concern that the plan contravened the State's longstanding rule against splitting counties, placed two incumbents' residences in the same district, and moved one-third of the State's population from one district to another. The following day, members of the Redistricting Committee introduced seven additional plans. The committee eventually reported to the full Senate the eighth proposal, referred to as S.B. The full Senate rejected a ninth proposal offered as an amendment on the floor and adopted S.B. by a vote of to The House of Delegates approved the bill without debate by a vote of to Governor Earl Tomblin signed the bill into law on August . S.B. codified at W. irginia Code Annotation (Lexis Supplement), does not split county lines, redistrict incumbents into the same district, or require dramatic shifts in the population of the current districts. Indeed, S.B. 's chief selling point was that it required very little change to the existing districts: It moved just one county, representing of the State's population, from one district to another. This was the smallest shift of any plan considered by the legislature. S.B. however, has a population variance of %, the second highest variance of the plans the legislature considered. That is, the population difference between the largest and smallest districts in S.B. equals of the population of the average district. The Jefferson County Commission and two of its county commissioners sued to enjoin the State from implementing S.B. At the State conceded that it could have adopted a plan with lower population variations. The State argued, however, that legitimate state policies justified the slightly higher variances in S.B. citing this Court's statement from Karcher that QUOTED TEXT U.S. at The State noted Karcher's approving reference to a District Court opinion upholding a previous West irginia redistricting plan with a population variance of virtually identical to the variance in S.B. See id., at (citing West irginia Civil Liberties Union versus Rockefeller, Federal Supplement (SD W. irginia )). The District Court nonetheless granted the injunction, holding that the State's asserted objectives did not justify the population variance. With respect to the objective of not splitting counties, the District Court acknowledged that West irginia had never in its history divided a county between two or more congressional districts. The court speculated, however, that the practice of other States dividing counties between districts QUOTED TEXT of respecting such boundaries as a potentially legitimate for population variances. The court also faulted the West irginia Legislature for failing QUOTED TEXT to the State's interest in respecting county boundaries and noted that several other plans under consideration also did not split counties. The court further questioned the State's assertion that S.B. best preserved the core of existing districts. Preserving the core of a district, the court reasoned, involved respecting the QUOTED TEXT id., at (quoting Graham versus Thornburgh, Federal Supplement (Kansas )), not a QUOTED TEXT Application to Juris. The District Court concluded that although acclimating to a new congressional district and Congressperson QUOTED TEXT Ibid. With respect to preventing contests between incumbents, the District Court again faulted the legislature for failing to build a record QUOTED TEXT to that asserted interest. And the District Court found that although was a variation when Karcher was decided, the feasibility of achieving smaller variances due to improved technology meant that the same variance must now be considered major. Because the District Court concluded that the redistricting plan was unconstitutional under Article I, it did not reach plaintiffs' challenges under the West irginia Constitution. Chief Bailey dissented. He argued that the record demonstrated the legitimacy of the State's concerns, and that no other plan satisfied all those concerns as well as S.B. He also took issue with the majority's disregard for Karcher's characterization of as an acceptable disparity. We stayed the District Court's pending to this Court, U.S. ), and now reverse. Given the State's concession that it could achieve smaller population variations, the remaining question under Karcher is whether the State can demonstrate that QUOTED TEXT U.S. at Considering, as Karcher instructs, QUOTED TEXT id., at it is clear that West irginia has carried its burden. As an initial matter, the District Court erred in concluding that improved technology has converted a QUOTED TEXT variation in Karcher into a QUOTED TEXT variation today. Nothing about technological advances in redistricting and mapping software has, for example, decreased population variations between a State's counties. See id., at n. Thus, if a State wishes to maintain whole counties, it will inevitably have population variations between districts reflecting the fact that its districts are composed of unevenly populated counties. Despite technological advances, a variance of results in no more (or less) vote dilution today than in when this Court said that such a harm could be justified by legitimate state objectives. Moreover, our cases leave little doubt that avoiding contests between incumbents and not splitting political subdivisions are valid, neutral state districting policies. See, e.g., id., at The majority cited no for requiring legislative findings on the QUOTED TEXT of the variance attributable to each factor, and we are aware of none. The District Court dismissed the State's interest in limiting the shift of population between old and new districts as QUOTED TEXT id., at because the State considered only QUOTED TEXT rather than QUOTED TEXT Id., at (quoting Graham versus Thornburgh, at ). According to the District Court, that did not qualify as QUOTED TEXT under Karcher, U.S. at Regardless of how to read that language from Karcher, however, our opinion made clear that its list of possible s for population variations was not exclusive. See id., at (QUOTED TEXT). The desire to minimize population shifts between districts is clearly a valid, neutral state policy. See, e.g., Turner versus Arkansas, Federal Supplement (ED Arkansas ), summarily aff'd, U.S. S.B. achieves significantly lower population shifts than the alternative plans more than four times lower than the closest alternative, and more than times lower than others. None of the alternative plans came close to vindicating all three of the State's legitimate objectives while achieving a lower variance. All other plans failed to serve at least one objective as well as S.B. does; several were worse with respect to two objectives; and the Perfect Plan failed as to all three of the State's objectives. See Application to Juris. This is not to say that anytime a State must choose between serving an additional legitimate objective and achieving a lower variance, it may choose the former. But here, given the small QUOTED TEXT as balanced against QUOTED TEXT and the lack of available QUOTED TEXT Karcher, at S.B. is justified by the State's legitimate objectives. Because the District Court did not reach plaintiffs' s under the West irginia Constitution and the issue has not been briefed by the parties, we leave it to the District Court to address the remaining s in the first instance. The judgment of the United States District Court for the Southern District of West irginia is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

case-574-13,unknown," On July , the Pennsylvania State Police Department received a report that a man named Michael Zita had stolen a car and two loaded handguns. The report also said that Zita might have fled to the home of Andrew and Karen Carman. The department sent Officers Jeremy Carroll and Brian Roberts to the Carmans' home to investigate. Neither officer had been to the home before. The officers arrived in separate patrol cars around p.m. The Carmans' house sat on a corner lot the front of the house faced a main street while the left (as viewed from the front) faced a side street. The officers initially drove to the front of the house, but after discovering that parking was not available there, turned right onto the side street. As they did so, they saw several cars parked side-by-side in a gravel parking area on the left side of the Carmans' The officers parked in the QUOTED TEXT at QUOTED TEXT Ibid. (quoting Tr. (Apr. )). The officers exited their patrol cars. As they looked toward the house, the officers saw a small structure (either a carport or a shed) with its door open and a light on. Thinking someone might be inside, Officer Carroll walked over, QUOTED TEXT in, and said QUOTED TEXT Federal d, at (quoting Tr. (Apr. ); alteration in original). No one was there, however, so the officers continued walking toward the house. As they approached, they saw a sliding glass door that opened onto a ground-level deck. Carroll thought the sliding glass door QUOTED TEXT so he and Officer Roberts decided to knock on it. Federal d, at (quoting Tr. (Apr. )). As the officers stepped onto the deck, a man came outof the house and QUOTED TEXT them. The officers identified themselves, explained they were looking for Michael Zita, and asked the man for his name. The man refused to answer. Instead, he turned away from the officers and appeared to reach for his waist. Carroll grabbed the man's right arm to make sure he was not reaching for a weapon. The man twisted away from Carroll, lost his balance, and fell into the yard. At that point, a woman came out of the house and asked what was happening. The officers again explained that they were looking for Zita. The woman then identified herself as Karen Carman, identified the man as her husband, Andrew Carman, and told the officers that Zita was not there. In response, the officers asked for permission to search the house for Zita. Karen Carman consented, and everyone went inside. The officers searched the house, but did not find Zita. They then left. The Carmans were not charged with any crimes. The Carmans later sued Officer Carroll in Federal District Court under U.S.C. Among other things, they alleged that Carroll unlawfully entered their in violation of the Fourth Amendment when he went into their backyard and onto their deck without a At Carroll argued that his entry was lawful under the QUOTED TEXT exception to the requirement. That exception, he contended, allows officers to knock on someone's door, so long as they stay QUOTED TEXT Tr. The Carmans responded that a normal visitor would have gone to their front door, rather than into their backyard or onto their deck. Thus, they argued, the QUOTED TEXT exception did not apply. At the close of Carroll's case in chief, the parties each moved for judgment as a matter of law. The District Court denied both motions, and sent the case to a As relevant here, the District Court instructed the that the QUOTED TEXT exception QUOTED TEXT Id., at (Apr. ). The District Court further explained that QUOTED TEXT Ibid. The then returned a for Carroll. The Carmans ed, and the Court of Appeals for the Third reversed in relevant part. The court held that Officer Carroll violated the Fourth Amendment as a matter of law because the QUOTED TEXT exception QUOTED TEXT Federal d, at The court also held that Carroll was not entitled to qualified immunity because his actions violated clearly established law. The court therefore reversed the District Court and held that the Carmans were entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Carroll petitioned for We grant the petition and reverse the Third 's that Carroll was not entitled to qualified immunity. A government official sued under is entitled to qualified immunity unless the official violated a statutory or constitutional right that was clearly established at the time of the challenged conduct. See Ashcroft versus al-Kidd, U.S. (slip opinion, at ). A right is clearly established only if its contours are sufficiently clear that QUOTED TEXT Anderson versus Creighton, U.S. This doctrine QUOTED TEXT and QUOTED TEXT Id., at (slip opinion, at (quoting Malley versus Briggs, U.S. ). Here the Third cited only a single case to support its decision that Carroll was not entitled to qualified immunity of Smith versus Marasco, Federal (CA3 ). Assuming for the sake of argument that a controlling could constitute clearly established federal law in these circumstances, see Reichle versus Howards, U.S. (slip opinion, at ), Marasco does not clearly establish that Carroll violated the Carmans' Fourth Amendment rights. In Marasco, two police officers went to Robert Smith's house and knocked on the front door. When Smith did not respond, the officers went into the backyard, and at least one entered the garage. The court acknowledged that the officers' QUOTED TEXT Id., at It held, however, that the District Court had not made the factual findings needed to decide that issue. For example, the Third noted that the record QUOTED TEXT and that QUOTED TEXT Ibid. The court therefore remanded the case for further proceedings. In concluding that Officer Carroll violated clearly established law in this case, the Third relied exclusively on Marasco's statement that QUOTED TEXT Id., at see Federal d, at (quoting Marasco, at ). In the court's view, that statement clearly established that a QUOTED TEXT must begin at the front door. But that conclusion does not follow. Marasco held that an unsuccessful QUOTED TEXT at the front door does not automatically allow officers to go onto other parts of the It did not hold, however, that knocking on the front door is required before officers go onto other parts of the that are open to visitors. Thus, Marasco simply did not answer the question whether a QUOTED TEXT must begin at the front door when visitors may also go to the back door. Indeed, the house at issue seems not to have even had a back door, let alone one that visitors could use. Moreover, Marasco expressly stated that QUOTED TEXT Ibid. That makes Marasco wholly different from this case, where the necessarily decided that Carroll QUOTED TEXT Tr. (Apr. ). To the extent that Marasco says anything about this case, it arguably supports Carroll's view. In Marasco, the Third noted that QUOTED TEXT Federal d, at The court also said that, QUOTED TEXT Ibid. (quoting W. LaFave, Search and Seizure (f edition and Supplement s omitted)). Had Carroll read those statements before going to the Carmans' house, he may have concluded quite reasonably that he was allowed to knock on any door that was open to visitors. ]* The Third 's decision is even more perplexing in comparison to the decisions of other federal and state courts, which have rejected the rule the Third adopted here. For example, in United States versus Titemore, Federal (CA2 ), a police officer approached a house that had two doors. The first was a traditional door that opened onto a driveway; the second was a sliding glass door that opened onto a small porch. The officer chose to knock on the latter. On the argued that the officer had unlawfully entered his without a in violation of the Fourth Amendment. But the Second rejected that argument. As the court explained, the sliding glass door was QUOTED TEXT Id., at Thus, QUOTED TEXT the court held that he did not violate the Fourth Amendment. The Seventh 's decision in United States versus James, Federal ), vacated on other grounds, U.S. provides another example. There, police officers approached a duplex with multiple entrances. Bypassing the front door, the officers QUOTED TEXT Federal d, at On the argued that the officers violated his Fourth Amendment rights when they went to the rear side door. The Seventh rejected that argument, explaining that the rear side door was QUOTED TEXT and QUOTED TEXT Ibid. In situations QUOTED TEXT the court held, QUOTED TEXT Ibid. See also, e.g., United States versus Garcia, Federal (CA9 (QUOTED TEXT); State versus Domicz, N.J. , A. (QUOTED TEXT). We do not decide today whether those cases were correctly decided or whether a police officer may conduct a QUOTED TEXT at any entrance that is open to visitors rather than only the front door. QUOTED TEXT Stanton versus Sims, U.S. (per curiam) (slip opinion, at (quoting al-Kidd, U.S. at (slip opinion, at )). The Third therefore erred when it held that Carroll was not entitled to qualified immunity. The petition for is granted.

On one visit, A.S. 's mother told the victim's that A.S. could be staying with an ex-boyfriend in Waukegan, Illinois, miles away. The police detective visited the Waukegan address but was informed by the ex-boyfriend's mother that she had not seen A.S. in several months and that A.S. was not staying with her or her son. The efforts to find A.S. continued until March the day of the hearing on the State's motion. On a final visit to A.S.

Whether or not the state court went too far in characterizing the 's efforts as QUOTED TEXT the state court identified the correct Sixth Amendment standard and applied it in a reasonable manner. The Seventh found that the State's efforts were inadequate for three main reasons. First, the Seventh faulted the State for failing to contact QUOTED TEXT Federal d, at But the record does not show that any of A.S. 's family members or any other persons interviewed by the State provided any reason to believe that any of these individuals had information about A.S. 's whereabouts. Second, the Seventh criticized the State because it did not make inquiries at the cosmetology school where A.S. had once been enrolled, ibid., but the court's own opinion observed that the information about A.S. 's enrollment at the cosmetology school after the mis was not QUOTED TEXT or QUOTED TEXT Ibid. Since A.S. had not attended the school for some time, Exhibit K, at there is no reason to believe that anyone at the school had better information about A.S. 's location than did the members of her family. Finally, the Seventh found that the State's efforts were insufficient because it had neglected to serve her with a after she expressed fear about ing at the re A.S. however, had expressed fear about ing at the first but had nevertheless appeared in court and had taken the stand. The State represented that A.S. although fearful, had agreed to at the re as well. We have never held that the must have issued a if it wishes to prove that a who goes into hiding is unavailable for Confrontation purposes, and the issuance of a may do little good if a sexual is so fearful of an assailant that she is willing to risk his by failing to at As we observed in Roberts, when a disappears before it is always possible to think of additional steps that the might have taken to secure the presence, see U.S. at but the Sixth Amendment does not require the to exhaust every avenue of inquiry, no matter how unpromising. And, more to the point, the deferential standard of review set out in U.S.C. does not permit a federal court to overturn a state court's decision on the question of unavailability merely because the federal court identifies additional steps that might have been taken. Under AEDPA, if the state-court decision was reasonable, it cannot be disturbed. The petition for a of and Cross' motion to proceed in forma pauperis are granted, and the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Seventh is Reversed. Notes The State's motion does not mention the investigator's March visit with A.S.

The officers wearing uniforms and driving a marked police vehicle approached the place where the disturbance had been reported and noticed three men walking in the street. Upon seeing the police car, two of the men turned into a nearby apartment complex. The third, Nicholas Patrick, crossed the street about yards in front of Stanton's car and ran or quickly walked toward a residence. Nothing in the record shows that Stanton knew at the time whether that residence belonged to Patrick or someone else; in fact, it belonged to Drendolyn Sims. Stanton did not see Patrick with a baseball bat, but he considered Patrick's behavior suspicious and decided to detain him in to investigate. see Terry versus Ohio, U.S. Stanton exited his patrol car, called out QUOTED TEXT and ed Patrick to stop in a voice loud enough for all in the area to hear. appendix to petition for of But Patrick did not stop. Instead, he QUOTED TEXT of a fence enclosing Sims' front yard. Id., at (alterations omitted). When the gate closed behind Patrick, the fence which was more than six feet tall and made of wood blocked Stanton's view of the yard. Stanton believed that Patrick had committed a jailable misdemeanor under California Penal Code by disobeying his to stop; Stanton also QUOTED TEXT appendix to petition for of He made the QUOTED TEXT to kick open the gate in pur of Patrick. Ibid. Unfortunately, and unbeknownst to Stanton, Sims herself was standing behind the gate when it flew open. The swinging gate struck Sims, cutting her forehead and injuring her shoulder. Sims filed against Stanton in Federal District Court under Review U.S.C. alleging that Stanton unreasonably searched her home without a in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The District Court granted summary judgment to Stanton, finding that: Stanton's entry was justified by the potentially dangerous situation, by the need to pursue Patrick as he fled, and by Sims' lesser expectation of privacy in the curtilage of her home; and even if a constitutional violation had occurred, Stanton was entitled to qualified immunity because no clearly established law put him on notice that his conduct was unconstitutional. Sims appealed, and a of the Court of s for the Ninth reversed. The court held that Stanton's less entry into Sims' yard was unconstitutional because Sims was entitled to the same expectation of privacy in her curtilage as in her home itself, because there was no immediate danger, and because Patrick had committed only the offense of disobeying a police officer. The court also found the law to be clearly established that Stanton's pur of Patrick did not justify his less entry, given that Patrick was suspected of only a misdemeanor. The court held that Stanton was not entitled to qualified immunity. We address only the latter holding here, and now reverse. QUOTED TEXT Pearson versus Callahan, U.S. (quoting Harlow versus Fitzgerald, U.S. ). QUOTED TEXT and QUOTED TEXT Ashcroft versus al-Kidd, U.S. (slip opinion, at (quoting Malley versus Briggs, U.S. ). QUOTED TEXT before concluding that the law is clearly established, QUOTED TEXT al-Kidd, U.S. at (slip opinion, at ). There is no suggestion in this case that Officer Stanton knowingly violated the Constitution; the question is whether, in light of existing at the time, he was QUOTED TEXT in entering Sims' yard to pursue the fleeing Patrick. The Ninth concluded that he was. It did so despite the fact that federal and state courts nationwide are sharply divided on the question whether an officer with probable cause to a suspect for a misdemeanor may enter a home without a while in hot pur of that suspect. Compare, e.g., Middletown versus Flinchum, Ohio St. , N.E. (QUOTED TEXT), and State versus Ricci, N.H. , A. (QUOTED TEXT where the had fled into his home with police officers in hot pur ), with Mascorro versus Billings, Federal (CA10 (QUOTED TEXT where QUOTED TEXT omitted)), and Butler versus State, Arkansas , S.W. (QUOTED TEXT). Other courts have concluded that police officers are at least entitled to qualified immunity in these circumstances because the constitutional violation is not clearly established. E.g., Grenier versus Champlin, Federal (CA8 (QUOTED TEXT where officers entered a home without a in hot pur of misdemeanor suspects who had defied the officers' to remain outside (internal quotation marks and omitted)). Notwithstanding this basic disagreement, the Ninth below denied Stanton qualified immunity. In its one-paragraph analysis on the hot pur point, the relied on two cases, one from this Court, Welsh versus Wisconsin, U.S. and one from its own, United States versus Johnson, Federal (en banc) (per curiam). Neither case clearly establishes that Stanton violated Sims' Fourth Amendment rights. In Welsh, police officers learned from a that Edward Welsh had driven his car off the road and then left the scene, presumably because he was drunk. Acting on that tip, the officers went to Welsh's home without a entered without and ed him for driving while intoxicated a nonjailable traffic offense under state law. Our opinion first noted our holding that hot pur of a fleeing felon justifies an officer's less entry. Id., at (citing United States versus Santana, U.S. )). But we rejected the suggestion that the hot pur exception applied: QUOTED TEXT U.S. at We went on to conclude that the officers' entry violated the Fourth Amendment, finding it QUOTED TEXT that QUOTED TEXT Ibid. In those circumstances, we said, QUOTED TEXT Ibid. But we did not lay down a categorical rule for all cases involving offenses, saying only that a is QUOTED TEXT required. In Johnson, police officers broke into Michael Johnson's fenced yard in search of another person (Steven Smith) whom they were attempting to apprehend on five misdemeanor s. The Ninth was clear that this case, like Welsh, did not involve hot pur QUOTED TEXT because Smith had escaped from the police minutes prior and his whereabouts were unknown. The court held that the officers' entry required a in part because Smith was wanted for only misdemeanor offenses. Then, in a the court said: QUOTED TEXT Johnson, at n. In concluding as it must have that Stanton was QUOTED TEXT al-Kidd, U.S. at (slip opinion, at ), the Ninth below read Welsh and the in Johnson far too broadly. First, both of those cases cited Santana with approval, a case that approved an officer's less entry while in hot pur And though Santana involved a suspect, we did not expressly limit our holding based on that fact. See U.S. at (QUOTED TEXT). Second, to repeat, neither Welsh nor Johnson involved hot pur Thus, despite our emphasis in Welsh on the fact that the crime at issue was indeed, a mere nonjailable civil offense nothing in the opinion establishes that the seriousness of the crime is equally important in cases of hot pur Third, even in the portion of Welsh cited by the Ninth below, our opinion is equivocal: We held not that less entry to a misdemeanant is never justified, but only that such entry should be rare. That is in fact how two California state courts have read Welsh. In both People versus Lloyd, California Application , California Reporter ), and In re Lavoyne M., California Application , California Reporter ), the California Court of refused to limit the hot pur exception to suspects. The court stated in Lloyd: QUOTED TEXT California Application d, at California Reporter, at It is especially troubling that the Ninth would conclude that Stanton was plainly incompetent and subject to personal for based on actions that were lawful according to courts in the where he acted. Compare al-Kidd, at (Kennedy, J., concurring) (slip opinion, at ). Finally, our that Welsh and Johnson are insufficient to overcome Stanton's qualified immunity is bolstered by the fact that, even after Johnson, two different District Courts in the Ninth have granted qualified immunity precisely because the law regarding less entry in hot pur of a fleeing misdemeanant is not clearly established. See Kolesnikov versus Sacramento County, Number WL In Garcia, a case with facts similar to those here, the District Court distinguished Johnson as a case where QUOTED TEXT WL n. Precisely the same facts distinguish this case from Johnson: Stanton was in hot pur of Patrick, he did see Patrick enter Sims' and he had every reason to believe that Patrick was just beyond Sims' gate. appendix to petition for of . To summarize the law at the time Stanton made his split-second decision to enter Sims' yard: Two opinions of this Court were equivocal on the lawfulness of his entry; two opinions of the State Court of affirmatively authorized that entry; the most relevant opinion of the Ninth was readily distinguishable; two Federal District Courts in the Ninth had granted qualified immunity in the wake of that opinion; and the federal and state courts of last resort around the Nation were sharply divided.

After an extensive series of state and federal-court proceedings concluded with this Court's denial of 's petitions for and for rehearing, the Ninth declined to issue its as normally required by Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure . The Ninth instead, sua sponte, construed 's motion to stay the pending the Ninth 's decision in a separate en banc case as a motion to reconsider a motion that it had denied six months earlier. Based on its review of that previously rejected motion, the court issued a stay a few days before 's scheduled execution. Even assuming, as we did in Bell versus Thompson, U.S. that Rule admits of any exceptions, the Ninth did not demonstrate that exceptional circumstances justified withholding its As a result, we conclude that the Ninth 's failure to issue its constituted an abuse of discretion. In an Arizona found of first-degree murder for the strangling of -year-old Lorimer Grove. The court to death. After 's and were affirmed on direct review, see State versus Schad, Arizona P. ), and Schad versus Arizona, U.S. again sought state habeas relief, alleging that his rendered ineffective assistance at sentencing by failing to discover and present sufficient mitigating evidence. The state courts denied relief. In August sought federal habeas relief. He again raised a of ineffective assistance at sentencing for failure to present sufficient mitigating evidence. The District Court denied 's request for an evidentiary hearing to present new mitigating evidence, concluding that was not diligent in developing the evidence during his state habeas proceedings. The District Court alternatively held that the proffered new evidence did not demonstrate that 's performance was deficient. The Ninth affirmed in part, reversed in part, and ed to the District Court for a hearing to determine whether 's state habeas was diligent in developing the state evidentiary record. Arizona petitioned for This Court granted the petition, vacated the Ninth 's opinion, and ed for further proceedings in light of Cullen versus Pinholster, U.S. ). See Ryan versus Schad, U.S. ).

On July , filed in the Ninth the first motion directly at issue in this case. This motion asked the court to vacate its judgment and to the District Court for additional proceedings in light of this Court's decision in Martinez versus Ryan, U.S. The Ninth denied 's motion on July . then filed a petition for This Court denied the petition on October , U.S. and denied a petition for rehearing on January . U.S. returned to the Ninth that day and filed a motion requesting a stay of the in light of a pending Ninth en banc case addressing the inter between Pinholster and Martinez. The Ninth denied the motion on February , QUOTED TEXT in Number Doc. p. But instead of issuing the the court decided sua sponte to construe 's motion QUOTED TEXT which the court had denied on July .

Number (Feb. ), appendix to petition for of A to A WL Graber dissented based on her conclusion that could not show prejudice. Arizona set an execution date of March , which prompted to file a motion for on February . The Ninth granted the motion on March , with Graber again noting her dissent. On March , Arizona filed a petition for rehearing and rehearing en banc with the Ninth The court denied the petition the same day, with eight judges dissenting in two separate opinions. On March Arizona filed an application to vacate the in this Court, along with a petition for This Court denied the application, with Justices Scalia and Alito noting that they would grant it. We now consider the petition. Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure sets forth the rule that QUOTED TEXT (Emphasis added.) The reason for this Rule is straightforward: QUOTED TEXT Bell, U.S. at Hence, once this Court has denied a petition, there is generally no need for further from the lower courts. See ibid. In Bell, Tennessee argued that Rule QUOTED TEXT the Court of Appeals received notice of the 's denial of There was no need to resolve this issue in Bell because we concluded that the Sixth had abused its discretion even if Rule authorized a stay of the after denial of As in Bell, we need not resolve this issue to determine that the Ninth abused its discretion here. Bell recognized that when state court judgments are reviewed in federal habeas proceedings, QUOTED TEXT based in principles of federalism, demand that federal courts QUOTED TEXT state judgments by allowing them to be enforced when federal proceedings conclude. As we noted, States have an QUOTED TEXT Id., at (quoting Calderon versus Thompson, U.S. in turn quoting Brecht versus Abrahamson, U.S. ). Elsewhere, we explained that QUOTED TEXT dictate that QUOTED TEXT Calderon, at (quoting C. Wright, A. Miller, E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure p. edition )). Deviation from normal procedures is a power QUOTED TEXT Calderon, at Even assuming a court of appeals has authority to do so, it abuses its discretion when it refuses to issue the once the has acted on the petition, unless extraordinary circumstances justify that Applying this standard in Bell, we found no extraordinary circumstances that could constitute a There, a capital unsuccessfully alleged in state post proceedings that his had been ineffective by failing to introduce sufficient mitigating evidence in the phase of On federal habeas review, he made the same argument. After the Sixth affirmed, the filed a petition for rehearing that QUOTED TEXT on his argument that the Sixth had overlooked new psychiatrist evidence. While the Sixth denied the petition, it stayed the issuance of its while the sought and, later, rehearing from the denial of the When this Court denied the petition for rehearing, the Sixth did not issue its Instead, the Sixth waited five months (and until two days before the scheduled execution) to issue an amended opinion that vacated the District Court's denial of habeas and ed for an evidentiary hearing on the ineffective-assistance-of- This Court reversed that decision, holding that the Sixth had abused its discretion due to its delay in issuing the without notifying the parties, its reliance on a previously rejected argument, and its disregard of comity and federalism principles. In this case, the Ninth similarly abused its discretion when it did not issue the As in Bell, the Ninth here declined to issue the based on an argument it had considered and rejected months earlier. And, by the time of the Ninth 's February , decision not to issue its it had been over months since we decided Martinez and nearly months since unsuccessfully asked the Ninth to reconsider its decision in light of Martinez. Further, there is no doubt that the arguments presented in the rejected July , motion were identical to those accepted by the Ninth the following February. styled his July motion a QUOTED TEXT Number Doc. p. As its suggests, the only presented in that motion was that 's post should have developed more evidence to support his ineffective-assistance-of- . These arguments were pressed so strongly in the July motion that QUOTED TEXT Id., at The Ninth had a full QUOTED TEXT but declined to do so, id., at which QUOTED TEXT Id., at We presume that the Ninth carefully considers each motion a capital presents on habeas review. See id., at (rejecting the notion that QUOTED TEXT). As a result, there is no indication that there were any extraordinary circumstances here that called for the court to revisit an argument sua sponte that it already explicitly rejected. Finally, this case presents an additional issue not present in Bell. In refusing to issue the the Ninth relied heavily upon Beardslee versus Brown, Federal (CA9 (per curiam), Beardslee, which precedes our Bell decision by more than six months, asserts the Ninth 's inherent authority to withhold a See appendix to petition for of A to A WL But Beardslee was based on the Sixth 's decision in Bell, which we reversed. See Beardslee, at (citing Thompson versus Bell, Federal )). That opinion, thus, provides no support for the Ninth 's decision. In light of the foregoing, we hold that the Ninth abused its discretion when it neglected to issue its The petition for a of and 's motion to proceed in forma pauperis are granted. The Ninth 's judgment is reversed, the is vacated, and the case is ed with instructions to issue the immediately and without any further proceedings. It is so ordered.

case-580-16-67,unknown," This case addresses the situation of an officer who having arrived late at an ongoing police and having witnessed shots being fired by one of several individualsin a house surrounded by other officers shoots and kills an armed occupant of the house without first giving a warning. According to the District Court and the Court of Appeals, the record, when viewed in the light most favorable to respondents, shows the following. Daniel Pauly was involved in a road-rage incident on a highway near Santa Fe, New Mexico. It was in the evening, and it was raining. The two women involved called to report Daniel as a QUOTED TEXT who was QUOTED TEXT Id., at The women then followed Daniel down the highway, close behind him and with their bright lights on. Daniel, feeling threatened, pulled his truck over at an off-ramp to confront them. After a nonviolent encounter, Daniel drove a short distance to a secluded house where he lived with his brother, Samuel Pauly. Sometime between p.m. and p.m., Officer Kevin Truesdale was dispatched to respond to the women's call. Truesdale, arriving after Daniel had already left the scene, interviewed the two women at the off-ramp. The women told Truesdale that Daniel had been driving recklessly and gave his license plate number to Truesdale. The state police dispatcher identified the plate as being registered to the Pauly brothers' address. After the women left, Officer Truesdale was joined at the off-ramp by Officers Ray White and Michael Mariscal. The three agreed there was insufficient probable cause to Daniel. Still, the officers decided to speak with Daniel to get his side of the story, QUOTED TEXT and find out if he was intoxicated. The officers split up. White stayed at the off-ramp in case Daniel returned. Truesdale and Mariscal drove in separate patrol cars to the Pauly brothers' address, less than a half mile away. Neither officer turned on his flashing lights. When Officers Mariscal and Truesdale arrived at the address they had received from the dispatcher, they found two different houses, the first with no lights on inside and a second one behind it on a hill. Lights were on in the second one. The officers parked their cars near the first house. They examined a vehicle parked near that house but did not find Daniel's truck. Officers Mariscal and Truesdale noticed the lights on in the second house and approached it in a covert manner to maintain officer safety. Both used their flashlights in an intermittent manner. Truesdale alone turned on his flashlight once they got close to the house's front door. Upon reaching the house, the officers found Daniel's pickup truck and spotted two men moving around inside the residence. Truesdale and Mariscal radioed White, who left the off-ramp to join them. At approximately p.m., the Pauly brothers became aware of the officers' presence and yelled out QUOTED TEXT and QUOTED TEXT Federal d, at In response, Officers Mariscal and Truesdale laughed and responded: QUOTED TEXT Ibid. Truesdale shouted once: QUOTED TEXT Ibid. Mariscal also yelled: QUOTED TEXT Ibid. The Pauly brothers heard someone yelling, QUOTED TEXT Ibid. Neither Samuel nor Daniel heard the officers identify themselves as state police. The brothers armed themselves, Samuel with a handgun and Daniel with a shotgun. One of the brothers yelled at the police officers that QUOTED TEXT Federal d, at The officers saw someone run to the back of the house, so Officer Truesdale positioned himself behind the house and shouted QUOTED TEXT Ibid. Officer White had parked at the first house and was walking up to its front door when he heard shouting from the second house. He half-jogged, half-walked to the Paulys' house, arriving QUOTED TEXT Ibid. see also Civil Number (D NM, Feb. ), appendix to petition for of When White heard that statement, he drew his gun and took cover behind a stone wall feet from the front of the house. Officer Mariscal took cover behind a pickup truck. Just QUOTED TEXT after the QUOTED TEXT statement, Daniel stepped part way out of the back door and fired two shotgun blasts while screaming loudly. A few seconds after those shots, Samuel opened the front window and pointed a handgun in Officer White's direction. Officer Mariscal fired immediately at Samuel but missed. QUOTED TEXT later, White shot and killed Samuel. The District Court denied the officers' motions for summary judgment, and the facts are viewed in the light most favorable to the Paulys. Because this case concerns the defense of qualified immunity, however, the Court considers only the facts that were knowable to the officers. Samuel's and Daniel filed against, inter alia, Officers Mariscal, Truesdale, and White. One of the s was that the officers were liable under Review U.S.C. for violating Samuel's Fourth Amendment right to be free from excessive force. All three officers moved for summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds. White in particular argued that the Pauly brothers could not show that White's use of force violated the Fourth Amendment and, regardless, that Samuel's Fourth Amendment right to be free from deadlyforce under the circumstances of this case was not clearly established. The District Court denied qualified immunity. A divided of the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuitaffirmed. As to Officers Mariscal and Truesdale, the court held that QUOTED TEXT Federal d, at The majority analyzed Officer White's separately from the other officers because QUOTED TEXT Ibid. Despite the fact that QUOTED TEXT the majority held that a could have concluded that White's use of deadly force was not reasonable. The majority also decided that this rule that a reasonable officer in White's position would believe that a warning was required despite the threat of serious harm was clearly established at the time of Samuel's death. The Court of Appeals' ruling relied on general statements from this Court's that QUOTED TEXT and QUOTED TEXT Id., at (citing, inter alia, Tennessee versus Garner, U.S. and Graham versus Connor, U.S. emphasis deleted; internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). The court concluded that a reasonable officer in White's position would have known that, since the Paulys could not have shot him unless he moved from his position behind a stone wall, he could not have used deadly force without first warning Samuel Pauly to drop his weapon. Moritz dissented, contending that the QUOTED TEXT Officer White's quick choice to use deadly force. Moritz explained that the majority also erred by defining the clearly established law at too high a level of generality, in contravention of this Court's The officers petitioned for rehearing en banc, which of the judges on the Court of Appeals voted to grant. In a dissent from denial of rehearing, Hartz noted that he was QUOTED TEXT Federal (CA10 ). Hartz expressed his hope that QUOTED TEXT Id., at The officers petitioned for The petition is now granted, and the judgment is vacated: Officer White did not violate clearly established law on the record described by the Court of Appeals Qualified immunity attaches when an official's conduct QUOTED TEXT Mullenix versus Luna, U.S. at (slip opinion, at ). While this Court's QUOTED TEXT for a right to be clearly established, QUOTED TEXT Id., at (slip opinion, at ). In other words, immunity protects QUOTED TEXT Ibid. In the last five years, this Court has issued a number of opinions reversing federal courts in qualified immunity cases. See, e.g., City and County of San Francisco versus Sheehan, U.S. n. (slip opinion, at n (collecting cases). The Court has found this necessary both because qualified immunity is important to QUOTED TEXT ibid., and because as QUOTED TEXT qualified immunity QUOTED TEXT Pearson versus Callahan, U.S. Today, it is again necessary to reiterate the longstanding principle that QUOTED TEXT should not be defined QUOTED TEXT Ashcroft versus al-Kidd, U.S. As this Court explained decades ago, the clearly established law must be QUOTED TEXT to the facts of the case. The majority misunderstood the QUOTED TEXT analysis: It failed to identify a case where an officer acting under similar circumstances as Officer White was held to have violated the Fourth Amendment. Instead, the majority relied on Graham, Garner, and their Court of Appeals progeny, which as noted abovelay out excessive-force principles at only a general level. For that reason, we have held that Garner and Graham do notby themselves create clearly established law outsideQUOTED TEXT Brosseau versus Haugen, U.S. (per curiam); see also Plumhoff versus Rickard, U.S. (slip opinion, at (emphasizing that Garner and Graham QUOTED TEXT). This is not a case where it is obvious that there was a violation of clearly established law under Garner and Graham. Of note, the majority did not conclude that White's conduct such as his failure to shout a warning constituted a run-of-the-mill Fourth Amendment violation. Indeed, it recognized that QUOTED TEXT in light of White's late arrival on the scene. This alone should have been an important indication to the majority that White's conduct did not violate a QUOTED TEXT right. Clearly established federal law does not prohibit a reasonable officer who arrives late to an ongoing police in circumstances like this from assuming that proper procedures, such as officer identification, have already been followed. No settled Fourth Amendment principle requires that officer to second-guess the earlier steps already taken by his or her fellow officers in instances like the one White confronted here. On the record described by the Court of Appeals, Officer White did not violate clearly established law. The Court notes, however, that respondents contend Officer White arrived on the scene only two minutes after Officers Truesdale and Mariscal and more than three minutes before Daniel's shots were fired. On the assumption that the conduct of Officers Truesdale and Mariscal did not adequately alert the Paulys that they were police officers, respondents suggest that a reasonable could infer that White witnessed the other officers' deficient performance and should have realized that corrective was necessary before using deadly force. This Court expresses no position on this potential alternative ground for affirmance, as it appears that neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals addressed it.

The Court of Appeals, despite the substantial deference it must accord to state-court rulings in federal habeas proceedings, determined that excusing the in the circumstances of this case violated the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments.

Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Act of (AEDPA), habeas relief is authorized if the state court's decision QUOTED TEXT U.S.C. ).

Witherspoon recognized that the Sixth Amendment's of an impartial confers on capital defendants the right to a not QUOTED TEXT U.S. at But the Court with equal clarity has acknowledged the State's QUOTED TEXT Uttecht versus Brown, U.S. To ensure the proper balance between these two interests, only QUOTED TEXT Ibid.

As a result, federal habeas reviewof a Witherspoon-Witt much like federal habeas review of an ineffective-assistance-of- must be QUOTED TEXT Burt, at (slip opinion, at (quoting Cullen versus Pinholster, U.S. ). The Court of Appeals held that the Kentucky unreasonably applied Witherspoon, Witt, and their progeny when it determined that removing for cause was constitutional.

The Court of Appeals further determined that if the when reviewing 's examination, had QUOTED TEXT between and the would not have been excused. Both the analysis and the conclusion in the decision under review were incorrect. While the Court of Appeals acknowledged that deference was required under AEDPA, it failed to ask the critical question: Was the Kentucky 's decision to the excusal of for cause QUOTED TEXT? Woodall, at (slip opinion, at (quoting Harrington, at ). The Court of Appeals did not properly apply the deference it was required to accord the state-court ruling. A fairminded jurist could readily conclude that the 's exchange with reflected a QUOTED TEXT; that she considered with care the 's and that she was fair in the exercise of her QUOTED TEXT in determining whether the was qualified to serve in this capital case. 's answers during voir dire were at least ambiguous as to whether he would be able to give appropriate consideration to imposing the death And as this Court made clear in Uttecht, QUOTED TEXT the court is QUOTED TEXT Id., at (quoting Witt, at ). The Court of Appeals erred in its assessment of the 's reformulation of an important part of 's questioning. When excusing the the day after the voir dire, the said that the had asked whether the QUOTED TEXT of penalties. appendix to petition for of a. The in fact asked if the was QUOTED TEXT the entire range of penalties. The 's confirmation that he was QUOTED TEXT the death ibid., was a reasonable basis for the to conclude that the was unable to give that fair consideration. The 's decision to excuse did not violate clearly established federal law by concluding that was not qualified to serve as a member ofthis capital See Witt, at And similarly, the Kentucky 's ruling that therewas no error is not beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement. The Court of Appeals noted that the deference toward courts recognized in Uttecht QUOTED TEXT the Federal d, at (quoting U.S. at ). It concluded that deference to the court here supported habeas relief, because the 's QUOTED TEXT did not lead her to immediately strike for cause. Nothing in Uttecht limits the court to evaluating demeanor alone and not the substance of a 's response. And the implicit suggestion that a is entitled to less deference for having deliberated after her initial ruling is wrong. In the ordinary case the conclusion should be quite the opposite. It is true that a court's contemporaneous assessment of a 's demeanor, and its bearing on how to interpret or understand the 's responses, are entitled to substantial deference; but a court ruling is likewise entitled to deference when made after a careful review of a formal or recording. If the chooses to reflect and deliberate further, as this did after the proceedings recessed for the day, that is not to be faulted; it is to be commended. This is not a case where QUOTED TEXT Uttecht, at The two federal s in the majority below might have reached a different conclusion had they been presiding over this voir dire. But simple disagreement does not overcome the two layers of deference owed by a federal habeas court in this context. The Kentucky was not unreasonable in its application of clearly established federal law when it concluded that the exclusion of did not violate the Sixth Amendment. Given this conclusion, there is no need to consider petitioner's further contention that, if there were an error by the court in excluding the it should be subject to harmless-error analysis. And this Court does not review the other rulings of the Court of Appeals that are not addressed in this opinion. As a final matter, this Court again advises the Court of Appeals that the provisions of AEDPA apply with full force even when reviewing a and imposing the death See, e.g., Parker versus Matthews, U.S. (per curiam); Bobby versus Dixon, U.S. (per curiam); Bobby versus Mitts, U.S. (per curiam); Bobby versus an Hook, U.S. (per curiam).

case-574-14-6873,unknown," Petitioner Mark Christeson's first federal habeas petition was dismissed as untimely. Because his appointed s who had missed the filing deadline could not be expected to argue that Christeson was entitled to the equitable tolling of the of limitations, Christeson requested substitute who would not be laboring under a conflict of interest. The District Court denied the motion, and the Court of Appeals for the Eighth summarily affirmed. In so doing, these courts contravened our decision in Martel versus Clair, U.S. ). Christeson's petition for is therefore granted, the judgment of the Eighth is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings. In a convicted Christeson of three counts of capital murder. It returned verdicts of death on allthree counts. The Missouri affirmed Christeson's and in see State versus Christeson, S.W. (en banc), and affirmed the denial of his post motion for relief in see Christeson versus State, S.W. (en banc). Under the strict -year of limitations imposed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Act of (AEDPA) U.S.C. ), Christeson's federal habeas petition was due on April . Nine months before this critical deadline, the District Court appointed s Phil Horwitz and Eric Butts to represent Christeson in his federal habeas proceedings. See18 U.S.C. (providing for appointment of for state death row inmates). Horwitz and Butts, as they have subsequently acknowledged, failed to meet with Christeson until more than six weeks after his petition was due. See appendix to petition for of a. There is no evidence that they communicated with their client at all during this time. They finally filed the petition on August days too late. They have since ed that their failure to meet with their client and timely file his habeas petition resulted from a simple miscalculation of the AEDPA limitations period (and in defending themselves, they may have disclosed privileged client communications). See id., at a a, a. But a legal ethics expert, reviewing 's handling of Christeson's habeas petition, stated in a report submitted to the District Court: QUOTED TEXT Id., at a. The District Court dismissed the petition as untimely, and the Court of Appeals denied Christeson's application for a certificate of ability. Christeson, who appears to have severe cognitive disabilities that lead him to rely entirely on his s, may not have been aware of this dismissal. See id., at a, a, a. Nearly seven years later, Horwitz and Butts contacted s Jennifer Merrigan and Joseph Perkovich to discuss how to proceed in Christeson's case. Merrigan and Perkovich immediately noticed a glaring problem. Christeson's only hope for securing review of the merits of his habeas s was to file a motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure seeking to reopen final judgment on the ground that AEDPA's of limitations should have been equitably tolled. But Horwitz and Butts could not be expected to file such a motion on Christeson's behalf, as any argument for equitable tolling would be premised on their own in failing to file timely the habeas petition. While initially receptive to Merrigan and Perkovich's assistance, Horwitz and Butts soon refused to allow outside access to their files. See appendix to petition for of a. On May , Merrigan and Perkovich filed a motion for substitution of The District Court denied the motion, explaining only that it was QUOTED TEXT as Merrigan and Perkovich are. The District Court did not address Merrigan and Perkovich's to forgo all fees and expenses associated with travel to Missouri, nor did it address the possibility of appointing other s for Christeson. Christeson ed. The Eighth dismissed for lack of apparently reasoning that Merrigan and Perkovich were not authorized to file an on Christeson's behalf. On September , while this was still pending before the Eighth the Missouri issued a of execution setting October , as Christeson's execution date.

Second, it observed that Horwitz and Butts had not QUOTED TEXT Christeson, as they had recently appeared on his behalf in a class- challenging Missouri's lethal injection protocol. Third, it noted that although Horwitz and Butts had represented Christeson before the Eighth that court had not appointed substitute Fourth and finally, the District Court expressed its belief that granting the motion would set QUOTED TEXT by allowing outside s to seek QUOTED TEXT delays in capital cases. Christeson again ed. This time, the Eighth summarily affirmed the District Court's We stayed Christeson's execution, see post, p. and now reverse. Congress has not, however, conferred capital habeas petitioners with the right to of their choice. Instead, the leaves it to the court to select a properly qualified See . But the contemplates that a court may QUOTED TEXT appointed with QUOTED TEXT of the petitioner. We addressed the standard that a court should apply in considering such a motion in Clair. We rejected the argument that substitution of an appointed lawyer is ed in only three situations: QUOTED TEXT U.S. at (slip opinion, at (internal quotation marks omitted). Instead, we adopted a broader standard, holding that a motion for substitution should be granted when it is in the QUOTED TEXT Id., at (slip opinion, at ). We further explained that the factors a court of s should consider in determining whether a district court abused its discretion in denying such a motion QUOTED TEXT Ibid. The District Court here properly recognized that its consideration of Christeson's motion for substitution was governed by Clair's QUOTED TEXT standard. But its denial of his motion did not adequately account for all of the factors we set forth in Clair. The court's error was its failure to acknowledge Horwitz and Butts' conflict of interest. Tolling based on 's failure to satisfy AEDPA's of limitations is available only for QUOTED TEXT Holland versus Florida, U.S. ). Advancing such a would have required Horwitz and Butts to denigrate their own performance. cannot reasonably be expected to make such an argument, which threatens their professional reputation and livelihood. See Restatement (Third) of Law Thus, as we observed in a similar context in Maples versus Thomas, U.S. n. (slip opinion, at n. ), a QUOTED TEXT arises when an 's QUOTED TEXT is at odds with his client's QUOTED TEXT Indeed, to their credit, Horwitz and Butts acknowledged the nature of their conflict. Shortly before the first motion for substitution was filed, they provided an update to the Missouri on the of Christeson's proceedings. In it, they stated:QUOTED TEXT appendix to petition for of a a. Yet, in their response to the District Court's to address the substitution motion, Horwitz and Butts characterized the potential arguments in favor of equitable tolling as QUOTED TEXT and asserted that they had QUOTED TEXT Id., at a, a. While not every case in which a ed habeas petitioner has missed AEDPA's of limitations will necessarily involve a conflict of interest, Horwitz and Butts' contentions here were directly and concededly contrary to their client's interest, and manifestly served their own professional and reputational interests. Clair makes clear that a conflict of this sort is grounds for substitution. Even the narrower standard we rejected in that case would have allowed for substitution where an has a QUOTED TEXT U.S. at (slip opinion, at ). And that standard, we concluded, would QUOTED TEXT the specific substitution-of- contained in which must contemplate the granting of such motions in circumstances beyond those where a petitioner effectively QUOTED TEXT as is the case when is conflicted. Indeed, we went so far as to say that given a capital 's QUOTED TEXT even QUOTED TEXT of a district court would be compelled QUOTED TEXT Ibid. Given the obvious conflict of interest here, the considerations relied upon by the District Court cannot justify its decision to deny petitioner new The second and third factors noted by the District Court that appointed continued to represent Christeson in challenging the means of his execution, and that the Eighth had not previously substituted are not substantial. Whether Horwitz and Butts had currently QUOTED TEXT Christeson is beside the point: Even if they were actively representing him in some matters, their conflict prevented them from representing him in this particular matter. Likewise, it is irrelevant that the Eighth had not previously sua sponte directed substitution of in the course of denying Christeson's request for a certificate of abilty and adjudicating his challenge to Missouri's execution protocol, when the conflict was not evident. The first and fourth factors cited by the District Court the delay in seeking substitution and the potential for abuse might be valid considerations in many cases. See Clair, U.S. at (slip opinion, at (QUOTED TEXT). But under the circumstances here, these factors alone cannot denial of substitution. Christeson's first substitution motion, while undoubtedly delayed, was not abusive. It was filed approximately a month after outside became aware of Christeson's plight and well before the State had set an execution date, and it requested only days to investigate and file a Rule motion. Nor is it plain that any subsequent motion that substitute might file on Christeson's behalf would be futile. See id., at (slip opinion, at (affirming denial of substitution motion as untimely where any filing made by substitute would have been futile). To be sure, Christeson faces a host of procedural obstacles to having a federal court consider his habeas petition. Although Christeson might properly raise a for relief pursuant to Rule see Gonzalez versus Crosby, U.S. ), to obtain such relief he must demonstrate both the motion's timeliness and, more significant here, that QUOTED TEXT Id., at (quoting Ackermann versus United States, U.S. )). That, in turn, will require Christeson to show that he was entitled to the equitable tolling of AEDPA's of limitations.

The decision of the Court of Appeals is therefore reversed. I Calvin Jackson had a tumultuous decade-long romantic relationship with Annette Heathmon. In after several previous attempts to end the relationship, Heathmon relocated to a new apartment in North Las egas without telling where she was moving. learned of Heathmon's whereabouts, and on the night of October , he visited her apartment. What happened next was the focus of 's Heathmon told police and later testified that forced his way into her apartment and threatened to kill her with a screwdriver if she did not have sex with him. After raping Heathmon, hit her, stole a ring from her bedroom, and dragged her out of the apartment and toward his car by the neck and hair. A confronted the couple, and fled. Police observed injuries to Heathmon's neck and scalp that were consistent with her account of events, and was eventually ed. Although did not at he discussed Heathmon's allegations with police shortly after his and his statements were admitted into evidence at acknowledged that Heathmon might have agreed to have sex because the two were alone and QUOTED TEXT Tr. but he claimed that the sex was consensual. also admitted striking Heathmon inside the apartment but denied pulling her outside by the neck and hair. Shortly before Heathmon sent the a letter recanting her prior accusations and stating that she would not She went into hiding, but police eventually found her and took her into custody as a material Once in custody, Heathmon disavowed the letter and agreed to When asked about the letter at she stated that three of 's associates had forced her to it and had threatened to hurt her if she appeared in court. At the theory of the defense was that Heathmon had fabricated the sexual and had reported it to police in an effort to control To support that theory, the defense sought to introduce and police reports showing that Heathmon had called the police on several prior occasions claiming that had or otherwise ed her. Police were unable to corroborate many of these prior allegations, and in several cases they were skeptical of her claims. Although the court gave the defense wide latitude to Heathmon about those prior incidents, it refused to admit the police reports or to allow the defense to call as es the officers involved. The found and he was sentenced to appealed his to the Nevada arguing, among other things, that the court's refusal to admit extrinsic evidence relating to the prior incidents violated his federal constitutional right to present a complete defense, but the Nevada rejected that argument. After exhausting his remedies in state court, filed a federal habeas petition, again arguing that the court's ruling had violated his right to present a defense. Applying AEDPA's deferential standard of review, the District Court denied relief, but a divided of the Ninth reversed. The majority held that extrinsic evidence of Heathmon's prior allegations was critical to 's defense, that the exclusion of that evidence violated 's constitutional right to present a defense, and that the Nevada 's decision to the contrary was an unreasonable application of this Court's s. Although it acknowledged that the state court had ruled that the evidence was inadmissible as a matter of state law, the Ninth concluded that the impact of the State's rules of evidence on the defense QUOTED TEXT Id., at Finding that the court's erroneous evidentiary ruling was not harmless, id., at the Ninth ed the State either to retry or to The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Act of (AEDPA) authorizes a federal habeas court to grant relief to a prisoner whose state court QUOTED TEXT U.S.C. ). It is settled that a federal habeas court may overturn a state court's application of federal law only if it is so erroneous that QUOTED TEXT Harrington versus Richter, U.S. (slip opinion, at ). Applying that deferential standard, we conclude that the Nevada 's decision was reasonable. QUOTED TEXT Crane versus Kentucky, U.S. (quoting California versus Trombetta, U.S. ), but we have also recognized that QUOTED TEXT Holmes versus South Carolina, U.S. (quoting United States versus Scheffer, U.S. ). Only rarely have we held that the right to present a complete defense was violated by the exclusion of defense evidence under a state rule of evidence. See U.S. at (rule did not rationally serve any discernible purpose); Rock versus Arkansas, U.S. (rule arbitrary); versus Mississippi, U.S. (State did not even attempt to explain the reason for its rule); Washington versus Texas, U.S. (rule could not be rationally defended). As the Ninth conceded, QUOTED TEXT Federal d, at But contrary to the Ninth 's conclusion, the State 's application of our clearly established s was reasonable. The starting point in the state court's analysis was a state that generally precludes the of extrinsic evidence of QUOTED TEXT appendix to petition for of see Nevada Review ). The purpose of that rule, the Nevada has explained, QUOTED TEXT Abbott versus State, Nevada , P. (quoting State versus Long, S.W. (Missouri )). These are QUOTED TEXT for limiting the use of extrinsic evidence, Clark versus Arizona, U.S. and the Nevada is akin to the widely accepted rule of evidence law that generally precludes the of evidence of specific instances of a conduct to prove the character for untruthfulness. See Federal Rule Evidence C. Mueller L. Kirkpatrick, Evidence pages th edition ). The constitutional propriety of this rule cannot be seriously disputed. As an exception to the prohibition contained in Nevada Review ), the Nevada held in Miller versus State, Nevada P. ), that QUOTED TEXT appendix to petition for of But in to introduce evidence showing that the previously made false allegations, the must file ten notice, and the court must hold a hearing. did not file the requisite notice, and the State upheld the exclusion of evidence of prior sexual complaints on this basis. No decision of this Court clearly establishes that this notice requirement is unconstitutional. Nor, contrary to the reasoning of the Ninth majority, see Federal d, at do our cases clearly establish that the Constitution requires a case-by-case balancing of interests before such a rule can be enforced. The decision on which the Ninth relied, Michigan versus Lucas, U.S. is very far afield. In that case, we reversed a decision holding that the Sixth Amendment categorically prohibits the enforcement of a rule that required a to provide pre notice if he wished to introduce evidence of his prior sexual relationship with the complaining The Court did not even suggest, much less hold, that it is unconstitutional to enforce such a rule unless a case-by-case balancing of interests weighs in favor of enforcement. Instead, the Court QUOTED TEXT and left it for the state courts to address that question in the first instance. No fair-minded jurist could think that Lucas clearly establishes that the enforcement of the Nevada rule in this case is inconsistent with the Constitution. Some of the evidence that sought to introduce concerned prior incidents in which the victim reported that beat her up but did not sexually her, and the state did not view its Miller decision as applying in such circumstances. But the state court did not simply invoke the rule set out in Nevada Review ). Rather, the court reasoned that the proffered evidence had little impeachment value because at most it showed simply that the victim's reports could not be corroborated. The of extrinsic evidence of specific instances of a conduct to impeach the credibility may confuse the unfairly embarrass the victim, surprise the and unduly prolong the No decision of this Court clearly establishes that the exclusion of such evidence for such reasons in a particular case violates the Constitution. In holding that is entitled to habeas relief, the Ninth pointed to two of its own AEDPA decisions in which it granted habeas relief to state prisoners who were not allowed to conduct a full cross-examination of the es against them. Federal d, at (discussing Fowler versus Sacramento Cty. Those cases in turn relied on decisions holding that various restrictions on a 's ability to es violate the Confrontation of the Sixth Amendment. See, e.g., Olden versus Kentucky, U.S. (per curiam); But this Court has never held that the Confrontation entitles a criminal to introduce extrinsic evidence for impeachment purposes. See Delaware versus Fensterer, U.S. (per curiam) (observing that QUOTED TEXT). See also Jordan versus Warden, Federal (CA6 ); Brown versus Ruane, Federal (CA1 ). The Ninth elided the distinction between cross-examination and extrinsic evidence by characterizing the cases as recognizing a broad right to present QUOTED TEXT Federal d, at By framing our s at such a high level of generality, a lower federal court could transform even the most imaginative extension of existing into QUOTED TEXT U.S.C. ). In thus collapsing the distinction between QUOTED TEXT and what a lower court believes to be QUOTED TEXT Williams versus Taylor, U.S. the Ninth 's approach would defeat the substantial deference that AEDPA requires. The petition for a of and 's motion to proceed in forma pauperis are granted. The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

case-565-469,unknown," Petitioners Darin Ryburn and Edmundo Zepeda, along with two other officers from the Burbank Police Department, responded to a call from Bellarmine-Jefferson High School in Burbank, California. When the officers arrived at the school, the informed them that a student, incent Huff, was rumored to have ten a letter threatening to QUOTED TEXT the school. appendix to petition for of The reported that many parents, after hearing the rumor, had decided to keep their children at home. The expressed concern for the safety of her students and requested that the officers investigate the threat. In the course of conducting interviews with the and two of incent's classmates, the officers learned that incent had been absent from school for two days and that he was frequently subjected to bullying. The officers additionally learned that one of incent's classmates believed that incent was capable of carrying out the alleged threat. The officers found incent's absences from school and his history of being subjected to bullying as cause for concern. The officers had received training on targeted school violence and were aware that these characteristics are common among perpetrators of school shootings. The officers decided to continue the investigation by interviewing incent. When the officers arrived at incent's house, Officer Zepeda knocked on the door and announced several times that the officers were with the Burbank Police Department. No one answered the door or otherwise responded to Officer Zepeda's knocks. Sergeant Ryburn then called the home telephone. The officers could hear the phone ringing inside the house, but no one answered. Sergeant Ryburn next tried calling the cell phone of incent's mother, Mrs. Huff. When Mrs. Huff answered the phone, Sergeant Ryburn identified himself and inquired about her location. Mrs. Huff informed Sergeant Ryburn that she was inside the house. Sergeant Ryburn then inquired about incent's location, and Mrs. Huff informed him that incent was inside with her. Sergeant Ryburn told Mrs. Huff that he and the other officers were outside and requested to speak with her, but Mrs. Huff hung up the phone. One or two minutes later, Mrs. Huff and incent walked out of the house and stood on the front steps. Officer Zepeda advised incent that he and the other officers were there to discuss the threats. incent, apparently aware of the rumor that was circulating at his school, responded, QUOTED TEXT Id., at Sergeant Ryburn asked Mrs. Huff if they could continue the discussion inside the house, but she refused. In Sergeant Ryburn's experience as a juvenile bureau sergeant, it was QUOTED TEXT for a parent to decline an officer's request to interview a juvenile inside. Sergeant Ryburn also found it odd that Mrs. Huff never asked the officers the reason for their visit. After Mrs. Huff declined Sergeant Ryburn's request to continue the discussion inside, Sergeant Ryburn asked her if there were any guns in the house. Mrs. Huff responded by QUOTED TEXT Id., at Sergeant Ryburn, who was QUOTED TEXT and had QUOTED TEXT entered the house behind her. incent entered the house behind Sergeant Ryburn, and Officer Zepeda entered after incent. Officer Zepeda was concerned about QUOTED TEXT and did not want Sergeant Ryburn to enter the house alone. The two remaining officers, who had been standing out of earshot while Sergeant Ryburn and Officer Zepeda talked to incent and Mrs. Huff, entered the house last, on the assumption that Mrs. Huff had given Sergeant Ryburn and Officer Zepeda permission to enter. Upon entering the house, the officers remained in the living room with Mrs. Huff and incent. Eventually, incent's father entered the room and challenged the officers' authority to be there. The officers remained inside the house for a total of to minutes. During that time, the officers talked to Mr. Huff and incent. They did not conduct any search of Mr. Huff, Mrs. Huff, or incent, or any of their The officers ultimately concluded that the rumor about incent was false, and they reported their conclusion to the school. The Huffs brought this against the officers under Review U.S.C. The complaint alleges that the officers violated the Huffs' Fourth Amendment rights by entering their home without a Following a -day the District Court entered judgment in favor of the officers. The District Court resolved conflicting regarding Mrs. Huff's response to Sergeant Ryburn's inquiry about guns by finding that Mrs. Huff QUOTED TEXT appendix to petition for of The District Court concluded that the officers were entitled to qualified immunity because Mrs. Huff's odd behavior, combined with the information the officers gathered at the school, could have led reasonable officers to believe QUOTED TEXT Id., at The District Court noted that QUOTED TEXT Id., at With respect to this kind of QUOTED TEXT the District Court explained, courts should be especially reluctant QUOTED TEXT Id., at A divided of the Ninth affirmed the District Court as to the two officers who entered the house on the assumption that Mrs. Huff had consented, but reversed as to petitioners. The majority upheld the District Court's findings of fact, but disagreed with the District Court's conclusion that petitioners were entitled to qualified immunity. The majority acknowledged that police officers are allowed to enter a home without a if they reasonably believe that immediate entry is necessary to protect themselves or others from serious harm, even if the officers lack probable cause to believe that a crime has been or is about to be committed. But the majority determined that, in this case, QUOTED TEXT given that QUOTED TEXT Id., at Rawlinson dissented. She explained that QUOTED TEXT Id., at She faulted the majority for QUOTED TEXT that differed markedly from the District Court's findings of fact, which the majority had conceded must be credited. Rawlinson looked to QUOTED TEXT and concluded that, under the rationale articulated in those cases, QUOTED TEXT Id., at , Rawlinson's analysis of the qualified immunity issue was correct. No decision of this Court has found a Fourth Amendment violation on facts even roughly comparable to those present in this case. On the contrary, some of our opinions may be read as pointing in the opposition direction. In Brigham City versus Stuart, U.S. we held that officers may enter a residence without a when they have QUOTED TEXT We explained that QUOTED TEXT Id., at (quoting Mincey versus Arizona, U.S. ). In addition, in Georgia versus Randolph, U.S. the Court stated that QUOTED TEXT A reasonable police officer could read these decisions to mean that the Fourth Amendment permits an officer to enter a residence if the officer has a reasonable basis for concluding that there is an imminent threat of violence. In this case, the District Court concluded that petitioners had such an objectively reasonable basis for reaching such a conclusion. The District Court wrote: QUOTED TEXT appendix to petition for of This belief, the District Court held, was QUOTED TEXT particularly since the situation was QUOTED TEXT and the officers had to make quick decisions. The majority far removed from the scene and with the opportunity to dissect the elements of the situation confidently concluded that the officers really had no reason to fear for their safety or that of anyone else. As the majority saw things, it was irrelevant that the Huffs did not respond when the officers knocked on the door and announced their presence and when they called the home phone because the Huffs had no legal obligation to respond to a knock on the door or to answer the phone. The majority attributed no significance to the fact that, when the officers finally reached Mrs. Huff on her cell phone, she abruptly hung up in the middle of their conversation. And, according to the majority, the officers should not have been concerned by Mrs. Huff's re when they asked her if there were any guns in the house because Mrs. Huff QUOTED TEXT Id., at Confronted with the facts found by the District Court, reasonable officers in the position of petitioners could have come to the conclusion that there was an imminent threat to their safety and to the safety of others. The Ninth 's contrary conclusion was flawed for numerous reasons. First, although the majority purported to accept the findings of the District Court, it changed those findings in several key respects. As Rawlinson correctly observed, QUOTED TEXT Id., at The District Court's finding that Mrs. Huff QUOTED TEXT implicitly rejected Mrs. Huff's contrary that she walked into the house after telling the officers that she was going to get her husband. The majority upheld the District Court's findings of fact and acknowledged that it could not reverse the District Court simply because it QUOTED TEXT Id., at But the majority's that petitioners were not entitled to qualified immunity rested on an account of the facts that differed markedly from the District Court's finding. According to the majority, Mrs. Huff QUOTED TEXT after telling the officers QUOTED TEXT Id., at . Second, the majority appears to have taken the view that conduct cannot be regarded as a matter of concern so long as it is lawful. the majority concluded that Mrs. Huff's response to the question whether there were any guns in the house (immediately turning around and running inside) was not a reason for alarm because she was under no legal obligation to continue her conversation with the police. It should go without saying, however, that there are many circumstances in which lawful conduct may portend imminent violence. Third, the majority's method of analyzing the string of events that unfolded at the Huff residence was entirely unrealistic. The majority looked at each separate event in isolation and concluded that each, in itself, did not give cause for concern. But it is a matter of common sense that a combination of events each of which is mundane when viewed in isolation may paint an alarming picture. Fourth, the majority did not heed the District Court's wise that judges should be cautious about second-guessing a police officer's assessment, made on the scene, of the danger presented by a particular situation. With the benefit of hindsight and calm deliberation, the majority concluded that it was unreasonable for petitioners to fear that violence was imminent. But we have instructed that reasonableness QUOTED TEXT and that QUOTED TEXT Graham versus Connor, U.S. ). from the proper perspective of a reasonable officer forced to make a split-second decision in response to a rapidly unfolding chain of events that culminated with Mrs. Huff turning and running into the house after refusing to answer a question about guns, petitioners' belief that entry was necessary to avoid injury to themselves or others was imminently reasonable. In sum, reasonable police officers in petitioners' position could have come to the conclusion that the Fourth Amendment permitted them to enter the Huff residence if there was an objectively reasonable basis for fearing that violence was imminent.

case-574-1,unknown," When a state prisoner seeks federal habeas relief on the ground that a state court, in adjudicating a on the merits, misapplied federal law, a federal court may grant relief only if the state court's decision was QUOTED TEXT U.S.C. ). We have emphasized, time and again, that the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Act of (AEDPA), prohibits the federal courts of appeals from relying on their own to conclude that a particular constitutional principle is QUOTED TEXT See, e.g.,Marshall versus Rodgers, U.S. (per curiam) (slip opinion at ). Because the Ninth failed to comply with this rule, we reverse its decision granting habeas relief to Marvin Smith. I was arrested for the murder of his wife, Minnie Smith. On December , Mrs. Smith was found dead in the home she shared with and it was determined that she was killed by a massive blow to the head from a fireplace log roller. The home appeared to have been ransacked, and valuable jewelry was missing. The State charged with first-degree murder and offered substantial incriminating evidence at The presented evidence that QUOTED TEXT Federal (CA9 (second alteration in original). 's DNA was also found on the murder weapon, pieces of duct tape found near the body, and a burned matchstick that was found in the bedroom and that may have been used to inflict burns on the body. See id., at see also People versus Smith, WL (California Application, Dec. ). The missing jewelry was discovered in the trunk of 's car, wrapped in duct tape from the same roll that had provided the pieces found near the body. See Federal d, at 's DNA was found on the duct tape in his trunk. See Smith, WL at In addition, a criminologist testified that the ransacking of the Smiths' home appeared to have been staged. See Federal d, at defended in part on the basis that he could not have delivered the fatal blow due to rotator cuff surgery several weeks before the murder. See ibid. (He mounted this defense despite the fact that police had observed him wielding a -foot-long by to pry something out of a concrete slab at a construction site the week after the murder. See Smith, WL at .) The defense also suggested that one of 's former employees had committed the crime to obtain money to pay a he owed See Federal d, at At the close of evidence, the requested an aiding-and-abetting instruction, and the court agreed to give such an instruction. During closing argument, the contended that was physically able to wield the log roller that had killed Mrs. Smith, but he also informed the that, even if had not delivered the fatal blow, he could still be convicted on an aiding-and-abetting theory. See id., at The convicted of first-degree murder without specifying which theory of guilt it adopted. After a series of state-court proceedings not relevant here, the California Court of affirmed 's The state court rejected 's assertion that he had inadequate notice of the possibility of on an aiding-and-abetting theory. The court explained that QUOTED TEXT and noted that the QUOTED TEXT Smith, WL at . Furthermore, the court held that QUOTED TEXT Id., at The upshot was that QUOTED TEXT Id., at The California denied 's petition for review. filed a petition for habeas relief with the United States District Court for the Central District of California. The recommended granting relief, and the District Court summarily adopted the 's recommendation. The Ninth affirmed. The court acknowledged that the QUOTED TEXT because under California law QUOTED TEXT Federal d, at But the Ninth nevertheless concluded that 's Sixth Amendment and due process right to notice had been violated because it believed the (until it requested the aiding-and-abetting instruction) had tried the case only on the theory that himself had delivered the fatal blow. See id., at The Ninth did not purport to identify any case in which we have found notice constitutionally inadequate because, although the was initially adequately apprised of the offense against him, the focused at on one potential theory of at the expense of another. Rather, it found the instant case to be QUOTED TEXT the Ninth 's own decision in Sheppard versus Rees, Federal ), which the court thought QUOTED TEXT Federal d, at The court also rejected, as an QUOTED TEXT U.S.C. ), the California Court of 's conclusion that preliminary examination and the instructions conference put on notice of the possibility of on an aiding-and-abetting theory. See id., at .A The Ninth held, and does not dispute, that initially received adequate notice of the possibility of on an aiding-and-abetting theory. The question is therefore whether habeas relief is warranted because the State principally relied at on the theory that himself delivered the fatal blow. Assuming, arguendo, that a is entitled to notice of the possibility of on an aiding-and-abetting theory, the Ninth 's grant of habeas relief may be affirmed only if this Court's cases clearly establish that a once adequately apprised of such a possibility, can nevertheless be deprived of adequate notice by a ial decision to focus on another theory of at The Ninth pointed to no case of ours holding as much. Instead, the Court of s cited three older cases that stand for nothing more than the general proposition that a must have adequate notice of the charges against him. See Federal d, at (citing Russell versus United States, U.S. ); This proposition is far too abstract to establish clearly the specific rule needs. We have before cautioned the lower courts and the Ninth in particular against QUOTED TEXT Nevada versus Jackson, U.S. (per curiam) (slip opinion, at ). None of our decisions that the Ninth cited addresses, even remotely, the specific question presented by this case. See Russell, at for QUOTED TEXT U.S.C. failed to QUOTED TEXT); In re Oliver, at (instantaneous , and by acting as grand with no prior notice of charge to ); Cole, at (affirmance of criminal s QUOTED TEXT). Because our does not clearly establish the legal proposition needed to grant habeas relief, the Ninth was forced to rely heavily on its own decision in Sheppard, Of course, AEDPA permits habeas relief only if a state court's decision is QUOTED TEXT as determined by this Court, not by the courts of appeals. The Ninth attempted to evade this barrier by holding that Sheppard QUOTED TEXT Federal d, at But cannot QUOTED TEXT Marshall, U.S. at (slip opinion, at ). Sheppard is irrelevant to the question presented by this case: whether our clearly establishes that a 's focus on one theory of at can render earlier notice of another theory of inadequate. The Ninth also disagreed with what it termed the state court's QUOTED TEXT principally, the state court's holding that preliminary examination and the s' request for an aiding-and-abetting instruction shortly before closing arguments adequately put on notice of the 's aiding-and-abetting theory. Federal d, at (internal quotation marks omitted). The Ninth therefore granted relief under ), which permits habeas relief where the state-court QUOTED TEXT That holding cannot be sustained. In purporting to reject the state court's QUOTED TEXT the Ninth focused on preliminary examination by an investigator about conversations between and his cellmate. According to the investigator, the cellmate stated that told him that QUOTED TEXT; that made his house look like the site of a home invasion and that, when he left for work the morning of the murder, he left the window open and did not set the alarm. The investigator also testified that the cellmate did not QUOTED TEXT and that QUOTED TEXT committed the homicide. The California Court of held that these statements, taken together, suggested that was involved in planning and facilitating the crime but that the fatal blow might have been delivered by an Thus, the California court believed that even assuming that the information by itself was not sufficient, this naturally lent itself to on an aiding-and-abetting theory and so gave even greater notice of such a possibility. The Ninth also focused on the instructions conference, which occurred after the defense rested but before the parties' closing arguments. During that conference, s requested an aiding-and-abetting instruction, which further provided notice to The California Court of concluded that this case is distinguishable from Sheppard versus Rees, Federal because, unlike that case, the conference here did not occur immediately before closing arguments. The Ninth disagreed, holding that because QUOTED TEXT to the aiding-and-abetting instruction, this case QUOTED TEXT where the also QUOTED TEXT Federal d, at . Although the Ninth ed its disagreement with the state court was factual in nature, in reality its grant of relief was based on a legal conclusion about the adequacy of the notice provided. The Ninth believed that the events detailed above, even when taken together with the information filed against failed to measure up to the standard of notice applicable in cases like this. That ranked as a legal governed by ), not one of fact governed by ). But, as we have explained, the Ninth cited only its own for establishing the appropriate standard. Absent a decision of ours clearly establishing the relevant standard, the Ninth had nothing against which it could assess, and deem lacking, the notice afforded by the information and proceedings. It therefore had no basis to reject the state court's assessment that was adequately apprised of the possibility of on an aiding-and-abetting theory. The petition for a of is granted. The judgment of the United States Court of s for the Ninth is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered. Notes s that our decision in Lankford versus Idaho, U.S. although not cited by the Ninth clearly establishes the legal principle he needs. But Lankford is of no help to That case addressed whether a had adequate notice of the possibility of imposition of the death a far different question from whether had adequate notice of the particular theory of See id., at In Lankford, moreover, the court itself made specific statements that encouraged the to believe that the death was off the table.

case-575-14-618,unknown," Federal courts may grant habeas relief if the underlying state-court decision was ""contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by"" this Court. Here, the Sixth held that Cory Donald's provided ineffective assistance of under United States versus Cronic, U.S. when he was briefly absent during concerning other s. Because no decision from this Court clearly establishes that Donald is entitled to relief under Cronic, we reverse. I After a day of drinking and smoking marijuana, Cory Donald and four others Seante Liggins, Rashad Moore, Dewayne Saine, and Fawzi Zaya decided to rob a drug dealer named Mohammed Makki. Donald, Moore, and Liggins drove to Makki's home in Dearborn, Michigan, wearing black skull caps and coats. Moore and Donald entered the house, while Liggins waited in the car. Michael McGinnis, one of Makki's drug runners, was in the house at the time. When Donald and Moore came through the door, McGinnis raised his hands and dropped face-down to the floor. He heard a scuffle in the kitchen and two gunshots as someone said, '[L]et it go.' After that, McGinnnis felt a gun on the back of his head while someone rifled through his pockets saying, '[W]hat you got, what you got?' Donald versus Rapelje, WL (ED Michigan, Dec. ). He also heard one of the two men whisper to the other, 'I got shot, I got shot.' After Moore and Donald left, McGinnis found Makki slumped against the refrigerator dying. About seven minutes after they entered the house, Moore and Donald returned, guns in hand, to Liggins' car. Donald told the others that he had stolen and that Moore had accidentally shot him during the crime. That night, Donald checked into a hospital for a gunshot wound to his foot. Police arrested him about three weeks later. The State charged Donald with one count of first-degree murder and two counts of armed Liggins and Zaya pleaded and Donald was tried with Moore and Saine. His defense theory was that he was present at the scene of the crime but he did not participate. At the government sought to admit a chart chronicling phone calls from the day of the crime among Moore, Saine, and Zaya. Moore and Saine's s objected, but Donald's declined, saying: 'I don't have a dog in this race. It does not affect me at all.' The court admitted the exhibit and took a short recess. When the resumed, Donald's was not in the courtroom. At first, the indicated that he would wait for the But he then decided to proceed because Donald's had already indicated that the exhibit and did not apply to his client. About minutes later, the lawyer returned. The informed him that 'up until that point we only were discussing the telephone chart,' to which the replied, '[ ]es, your Honor, and as I had indicated on the record, I had no dog in the race and no interest in that.' The found Donald on all three counts. He was sentenced to for the -murder count and to concurrent prison terms of ½ to years for each of the armed counts. On Donald argued that he was entitled to a new because his 's absence during the phone call denied him his Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of The Michigan Court of Appeals rejected his and the Michigan denied review. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan granted federal habeas relief, and the Sixth affirmed. The Sixth held that the Michigan Court of Appeals' decision was both contrary to and involved an unreasonable application of this Court's decision in Cronic. In the normal course, s ing ineffective assistance of must satisfy the familiar framework of Strickland versus Washington, U.S. which requires a showing that 's performance was deficient"" and ""that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense."" And when reviewing an ineffective-assistance-of- ""a court must indulge a strong presumption that 's conduct falls within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance."" In Cronic, however, we held that courts may presume that a has suffered unconstitutional prejudice if he ""is denied at a critical stage of his ."" And in Bell versus Cone, U.S. we characterized a ""critical stage"" as one that ""held significant consequences for the ."" According to the Sixth these statements should have compelled the Michigan court to hold that the phone call was a ""critical stage"" and that 's absence constituted ineffective assistance. Without identifying any decision from this Court directly in point, the Sixth concluded that the relevant in this case was ""similar to"" our cases applying Cronic. a federal court may grant habeas relief only when a state court's decision on the merits was ""contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by"" decisions from this Court, or was ""based on an unreasonable of the facts."" Donald does not argue that the state-court decision in his case was factually erroneous. Instead, he argues that the decision was both contrary to and involved an unreasonable application of this Court's ineffective-assistance-of- cases. AEDPA's standard is intentionally ""difficult to meet."" White versus Woodall, U.S. (slip opinion, at (quoting Metrish versus Lancaster, U.S. (slip opinion, at )). We have explained that 'clearly established Federal law' for purposes of includes only the holdings, as opposed to the dicta, of this Court's decisions."" White, U.S. at (slip opinion, at (some internal quotation marks omitted). ""And an 'unreasonable application of' those holdings must be objectively unreasonable, not merely wrong; even clear error will not suffice."" To satisfy this high bar, a habeas petitioner is required to ""show that the state court's ruling on the being presented in federal court was so lacking in that there was an error well understood and comprehended in existing law beyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement."" Harrington versus Richter, U.S. Adherence to these principles serves important interests of federalism and comity. AEDPA's requirements reflect a ""presumption that state courts know and follow the law."" When reviewing state criminal convictions on review, federal s are required to afford state courts due respect by overturning their decisions only when there could be no reasonable dispute that they were wrong. Federal habeas review thus exists as ""a guard against extreme malfunctions in the state criminal justice systems, not a substitute for ordinary error correction through ."" Harrington, at (internal quotation marks omitted). This is especially true for s of ineffective assistance of where AEDPA review must be ""doubly deferential"" in to afford ""both the state court and the defense the benefit of the doubt."" Burt versus Titlow, U.S. (slip opinion, at (quoting Cullen versus Pinholster, U.S. (slip opinion, at )). The Sixth should not have affirmed the Cronic-based grant of habeas relief in this case. The Michigan Court of Appeals' decision was not contrary to any clearly established holding of this Court. We have never addressed whether the rule announced in Cronic applies to regarding co s' actions. In Cronic itself, we rejected the 's that his 's lack of experience and short time for preparation warranted a presumption of prejudice, not a based on 's absence. See U.S. at When announcing the rule in Cronic, we cited earlier cases finding prejudice where was either totally absent, or prevented from assisting the during a critical stage of the proceeding."" But none of those cases dealt with circumstances like those present here. And Bell did not involve the absence of instead, we declined to presume prejudice where a capital 's ""failed to 'mount some case for life' after the introduced evidence in the sentencing hearing and gave a closing statement."" Because none of our cases confront ""the specific question presented by this case,"" the state court's decision could not be ""contrary to"" any holding from this Court. The most that the Sixth could muster was that ""[t]he of a government is similar to the events that th[is] Court has deemed to be critical stages."" But that conclusion is doubly wrong. First, if the circumstances of a case are only ""similar to"" our precedents, then the state court's decision is not ""contrary to"" the holdings in those cases. See, e.g., Carey versus Musladin, U.S. and n. ). Second, the Sixth framed the issue at too high a level of generality. See, e.g., Lopez, at (slip opinion, at ). The relevant was not merely of a government ""; it was about other s. To be sure, the Sixth considered the relevant to Donald because he was being prosecuted on an aiding-and-abetting theory for murder. But Donald's position was that he had nothing to do with the planning among his co s. And none of our holdings address 's absence during that is irrelevant within the 's own theory of the case. Nor was the state court's decision an unreasonable application of our cases. The Sixth stated ""that a critical stage of is a 'step of a criminal proceeding that h[olds] significant consequences for the .' Federal ppendix, at (quoting Bell, at ). And it held that the Michigan Court of Appeals' decision was ""objectively unreasonable"" because the phone call evidence might have indirectly inculpated Donald in the eyes of the But that holding is not correct.

case-565-23,unknown," Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Act, a state prisoner seeking a of habeas from a federal court QUOTED TEXT Harrington versus Richter, U.S. (slip opinion, at ). The Court of Appeals for the Sixth purported to identify three such grievous errors in the Ohio 's affirmance of Archie Dixon's murder Because it is not clear that the Ohio erred at all, much less erred so transparently that no fairminded jurist could agree with that court's decision, the Sixth 's judgment must be reversed. Archie Dixon and Tim Hoffner murdered Chris Hammer in to steal his car. Dixon and Hoffner beat Hammer, tied him up, and buried him alive, pushing the struggling Hammer down into his grave while they shoveled dirt on top of him. Dixon then used Hammer's birth certificate and social card to obtain a state identification card in Hammer's name. After using that identification card to establish ownership of Hammer's car, Dixon sold the vehicle for Hammer's mother reported her son missing the day after his murder. While investigating Hammer's disappearance, police had various encounters with Dixon, three of which are relevant here. On November , a police detective spoke with Dixon at a local police station. It is undisputed that this was a chance encounter Dixon was apparently visiting the police station to retrieve his own car, which had been impounded for a traffic violation. The detective issued Miranda warnings to Dixon and then asked to talk to him about Hammer's disappearance. See Miranda versus Arizona, U.S. ). Dixon declined to answer questions without his lawyer present and left the station. As their investigation continued, police determined that Dixon had sold Hammer's car and forged Hammer's signature when cashing the check he received in that sale. Police arrested Dixon for forgery on the morning of November Beginning at a.m. detectives intermittently interrogated Dixon over several hours, speaking with him for about minutes total. Prior to the interrogation, the detectives had decided not to provide Dixon with Miranda warnings for fear that Dixon would again refuse to speak with them. Dixon readily admitted to obtaining the identification card in Hammer's name and signing Hammer's name on the check, but said that Hammer had given him permission to sell the car. Dixon claimed not to know where Hammer was, although he said he thought Hammer might have left for Tennessee. The detectives challenged the plausibility of Dixon's tale and told Dixon that Tim Hoffner was providing them more useful information. At one point a detective told Dixon that QUOTED TEXT whether he had any involvement in Hammer's disappearance because QUOTED TEXT appendix to petition for of a. Dixon responded that, if Hoffner knew anything about Hammer's disappearance, Hoffner had not told him. Dixon insisted that he had told police everything he knew and that he had QUOTED TEXT to do with Hammer's disappearance. At approximately p.m. the interrogation concluded, and the detectives brought Dixon to a correctional facility where he was booked on a forgery charge. The same afternoon, Hoffner led police to Hammer's grave. Hoffner claimed that Dixon had told him that Hammer was buried there. After concluding their interview with Hoffner and releasing him, the police had Dixon transported back to the police station. Dixon arrived at the police station at about p.m. Prior to any police questioning, Dixon stated that he had heard the police had found a body and asked whether Hoffner was in custody. The police told Dixon that Hoffner was not, at which point Dixon said, QUOTED TEXT State versus Dixon, Ohio St. , -Ohio N.E. . The police read Dixon his Miranda rights, obtained a signed waiver of those rights, and spoke with Dixon for about half an hour. At p.m. the police, now using a tape rec again advised Dixon of his Miranda rights. In a detailed confession, Dixon admitted to murdering Hammer but attempted to pin the lion's share of the blame on Hoffner. At Dixon's the Ohio court excluded both Dixon's initial confession to forgery and his later confession to murder. The State took an interlocutory The State did not dispute that Dixon's forgery confession was properly suppressed, but argued that the murder confession was admissible because Dixon had received Miranda warnings prior to that confession. The Ohio Court of Appeals agreed and allowed Dixon's murder confession to be admitted as evidence. Dixon was convicted of murder, kidnaping, and forgery, and to death. The Ohio affirmed Dixon's s and To analyze the admissibility of Dixon's murder confession, the court applied Oregon versus Elstad, U.S. ). The Ohio found that Dixon's confession to murder after Miranda warnings was admissible because that confession and his prior, unwarned confession to forgery were both voluntary. State versus Dixon, at N.E. d, at see Elstad, at (QUOTED TEXT). Dixon then filed a petition for a of habeas under U.S.C. in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. Dixon claimed, inter alia, that the state court decisions allowing the of his murder confession contravened clearly established federal law. The District Court denied relief, but a divided of the Sixth reversed. The Sixth had authority to issue the of habeas only if the Ohio 's decision QUOTED TEXT as set forth in this Court's holdings, or was QUOTED TEXT in light of the state court record. see Harrington, U.S. at (slip opinion, at ). The Sixth believed that the Ohio 's decision contained three such egregious errors. First, according to the Sixth the Miranda decision itself clearly established that police could not speak to Dixon on November because on November Dixon had refused to speak to police without his lawyer. That is plainly wrong. It is undisputed that Dixon was not in custody during his chance encounter with police on November And this Court has QUOTED TEXT McNeil versus Wisconsin, U.S. , n. ); see also Montejo versus Louisiana, U.S. (slip. Second, the Sixth held that police violated the Fifth Amendment by urging Dixon to QUOTED TEXT before his Hoffner did so. The Sixth cited no of this Court or any court holding that this common police tactic is unconstitutional. Compare, e.g., Elstad, at (QUOTED TEXT). Because no holding of this Court suggests, much less clearly establishes, that police may not urge a suspect to confess before another suspect does so, the Sixth had no authority to issue the on this ground. Third, the Sixth held that the Ohio unreasonably applied this Court's in Elstad. In that case, a suspect who had not received Miranda warnings confessed to as police took him into custody. Approximately an hour later, after he had received Miranda warnings, the suspect again confessed to the same This Court held that the later, warned confession was admissible because QUOTED TEXT U.S. at omitted). As the Ohio 's opinion explained, the circumstances surrounding Dixon's interrogations demonstrate that his statements were voluntary. During Dixon's first interrogation, he received several breaks, was given water and offered food, and was not abused or threatened. He freely acknowledged that he had forged Hammer's name, even stating that the police were QUOTED TEXT to that information, and he had no difficulty denying that he had anything to do with Hammer's disappearance. Prior to his second interrogation, Dixon made an unsolicited declaration that he had spoken with his and wanted to tell the police what had happened to Hammer. Then, before giving his taped confession, Dixon twice received Miranda warnings and signed a waiver-of-rights form which stated that he was acting of his own free will. The Ohio recognized that Dixon's first interrogation involved QUOTED TEXT The court concluded, however, that QUOTED TEXT and thus there was no reason to suppress Dixon's later, warned confession. Ohio St. d, at N.E. d, at (citing Elstad, at ). The Sixth disagreed, believing that Dixon's confession was inadmissible under Elstad because it was the product of a QUOTED TEXT Federal d, at In so holding, the Sixth relied heavily on this Court's decision in Missouri versus Seibert, U.S. ). In Seibert, police employed a two-step strategy to reduce the effect of Miranda warnings: A detective exhaustively questioned Seibert until she confessed to murder and then, after a to -minute break, gave Seibert Miranda warnings and led her to repeat her prior confession. The Court held that Seibert's second confession was inadmissible as evidence against her even though it was preceded by a Miranda warning. A plurality of the Court reasoned that QUOTED TEXT U.S. at see also id., at (detailing a QUOTED TEXT). Justice Kennedy concurred in the judgment, noting he QUOTED TEXT Id., at In this case, no two-step interrogation technique of the type that concerned the Court in Seibert undermined the Miranda warnings Dixon received. In Seibert, the suspect's first, unwarned interrogation left QUOTED TEXT making it QUOTED TEXT not to QUOTED TEXT U.S. at (plurality opinion). But in this case Dixon steadfastly maintained during his first, unwarned interrogation that he had QUOTED TEXT to do with Hammer's disappearance. appendix to petition for of a. Thus, unlike in Seibert, there is no concern here that police gave Dixon Miranda warnings and then led him to repeat an earlier murder confession, because there was no earlier confession to repeat. Indeed, Dixon contradicted his prior unwarned statements when he confessed to Hammer's murder. Nor is there any evidence that police used Dixon's earlier to forgery to induce him to waive his right to silence later: Dixon declared his desire to tell police what happened to Hammer before the second interrogation session even began. As the Ohio reasonably concluded, there was simply QUOTED TEXT between Dixon's unwarned to forgery and his later, warned confession to murder. Moreover, in Seibert the Court was concerned that the Miranda warnings did not QUOTED TEXT because the unwarned and warned interrogations blended into one QUOTED TEXT U.S. at . Given all the circumstances of this case, that is not so here. Four hours passed between Dixon's unwarned interrogation and his receipt of Miranda rights, during which time he traveled from the police station to a separate jail and back again; claimed to have spoken to his lawyer; and learned that police were talking to his and had found Hammer's body. Things had changed. Under Seibert, this significant break in time and dramatic change in circumstances created QUOTED TEXT ensuring that Dixon's prior, unwarned interrogation did not undermine the effectiveness of the Miranda warnings he received before confessing to Hammer's murder. U.S. at see also id., at (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment) (QUOTED TEXT). The of Dixon's murder confession was consistent with this Court's s: Dixon received Miranda warnings before confessing to Hammer's murder; the effectiveness of those warnings was not impaired by the sort of QUOTED TEXT condemned in Seibert; and there is no evidence that any of Dixon's statements was the product of actual coercion. That does not excuse the detectives' decision not to give Dixon Miranda warnings before his first interrogation. But the Ohio courts recognized that failure and imposed the appropriate exclusion of Dixon's forgery confession and the attendant statements given without the benefit of Miranda warnings. Because no of this Court required Ohio to do more, the Sixth was without authority to overturn the reasoned judgment of the State's highest court. The petition for a of and 's motion to proceed in forma pauperis are granted. The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

We therefore grant Martinez's petition for and reverse the judgment of the Illinois A The State of Illinois indicted Martinez in August on charges of aggravated and mob against Avery Binion and Demarco Scott. But Martinez's date did not arrive for nearly four years. The story picks up for present purposes on July , when the State moved to continue an August date because it had not located the complaining es, Binion and Scott. The State subpoenaed both men four days later, and the court rescheduled Martinez's to September But the State sought another continuance, shortly before that date, because it still had not found Binion and Scott. The court rescheduled the to November and the State reissued subpoenas. But November came and went (the court continued the case when Martinez showed up late) and the was eventually delayed to the following March In early February, the State yet again subpoenaed Binion and Scott. When March arrived, the court granted the State another continuance. It reset the date for May and ordered Binion and Scott to appear in court on May And the State once more issued subpoenas. On the morning of May however, Binion and Scott were again nowhere to be found. At when the was set to begin, the State asked for a continuance. The court offered to delay swearing the jurors until a complete had been empaneled and told the State that it could at that point either have the sworn or move to dismiss its case. When Binion and Scott still had not shown up after the was chosen, the court offered to call the other cases on its docket so as to delay swearing the a bit longer. But when all these delays had run out, Binion and Scott were still nowhere in sight. The State filed a ten motion for a continuance, arguing that it was QUOTED TEXT without Binion and Scott.

But it was referring to the case of Illinois versus Somerville, U.S. in which we declined to apply QUOTED TEXT reasoning in answering a very different question: not whether jeopardy had attached, but whether the manner in which it terminated (by mis barred the 's re By contrast, Serfass explains, the rule that jeopardy attaches at the start of a is QUOTED TEXT U.S. at And contrary to the Illinois 's interpretation, Serfass creates not the slightest doubt about when a QUOTED TEXT begins. The Illinois 's error was consequential, for it introduced confusion into what we have consistently treated as a bright-line rule: A begins, and jeopardy attaches, when the is sworn. We have never suggested the exception perceived by the Illinois that jeopardy may not have attached where, under the circumstances of a particular case, the was not genuinely at risk of Martinez was subjected to jeopardy because the in his case was sworn. QUOTED TEXT however, QUOTED TEXT Id., at The remaining question is whether the jeopardy ended in such a manner that the may not be retried. See LaFave (surveying circumstances in which re is and is not allowed). Here, there is no doubt that Martinez's jeopardy ended in a manner that bars his re The court acquitted him of the charged offenses. And the court clearly made such a ruling here. After the State declined to present evidence against Martinez, his moved for QUOTED TEXT and the court QUOTED TEXT Tr. That is a textbook a finding that the State's evidence cannot support a The Illinois thought otherwise. It first opined that QUOTED TEXT IL N.E. d, at But the premise of that argument is incorrect: Martinez was in jeopardy, for the reasons given above. The court went on to QUOTED TEXT the court QUOTED TEXT Ibid. Under our precedents, however, that is immaterial: QUOTED TEXT; it turns on QUOTED TEXT Martin Linen, U.S. at see also Evans, at (slip opinion, at (QUOTED TEXT); United States versus Scott, U.S. (QUOTED TEXT). Here, as in Evans and Martin Linen, the court's was an because the court QUOTED TEXT Evans, at (slip opinion, at ); see Martin Linen, at (QUOTED TEXT). And because Martinez was acquitted, the State cannot retry him. The functional rule adopted by the Illinois is not necessary to avoid unfairness to s or to the public. On the day of the court was acutely aware of the significance of swearing a It repeatedly delayed that act to give the State additional time to find its es. It had previously granted the State a number of continuances for the same purpose. See at And, critically, the court told the State on the day of that it could QUOTED TEXT before the was sworn. Had the State accepted that invitation, the Double Jeopardy would not have barred it from recharging Martinez. Instead, the State participated in the selection of jurors and did not ask for dismissal before the was sworn. When the State declined to dismiss its case, Here, the State knew, or should have known, that an forever bars the re of the when it occurs after jeopardy has attached. The Illinois 's holding is understandable, given the significant consequence of the State's mistake, but it runs directly counter to our precedents and to the protection conferred by the Double Jeopardy The motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis and the petition for a of are granted. The judgment of the of Illinois is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. It is so ordered. Notes Much of that delay was due to Martinez and his See IL n. N.E. , n. (summarizing the lengthy procedural history). These facts are set forth in the opinion of the Illinois Appellate Court. Southern Reporterthern Reportere commentators have suggested that there may be limited exceptions to this rule e.g., where the court lacks or where a obtains an by or corruption. See W. LaFave, J. Israel, N. King, O. Kerr, Criminal Procedure edition ). The scope of any such exceptions is not presented here. Nor need we reach a situation where the had no opportunity to dismiss the charges to avoid the consequences of empaneling the Compare People versus Deems, Illinois N.E. ). Indeed, even if the court had chosen to dismiss the case or declare a mis rather than granting Martinez's motion for a directed the Double Jeopardy probably would still bar his re We confronted precisely this scenario in Downum versus United States, holding that once jeopardy has attached, the absence of es generally does not constitute the kind of QUOTED TEXT in which a court may exercise QUOTED TEXT Id., at see also Arizona versus Washington,",12811,2176,108,19.95,9.63,518,44.39,720,"The,of,to,on,His,the,When,the,in,the,and,the,to,its,the,to,any,So,for,a,and,the,it,The,that,the,its,for,a,The,whether,the,the,to,in,the,of,to,a,The,in,the,on,the,that,because,Our,the,that,at,no,that,to,And,because,the,the,to,a,no,that,We,therefore,for,and,the,of,the,A,The,of,in,on,of,and,against,and,But,for,The,up,for,on,when,the,to,because,it,the,and,The,both,and,the,to,But,the,another,before,that,because,it,and,The,the,to,and,the,But,and,the,the,when,up,and,the,to,the,In,the,yet,and,When,the,the,another,It,the,for,and,and,to,in,on,And,the,once,On,the,of,however,and,to,At,when,the,to,the,for,a,The,to,the,until,a,and,the,that,it,at,that,either,the,or,to,its,When,and,up,after,the,the,to,the,other,on,its,so,as,to,the,a,But,when,all,these,and,in,The,a,for,a,that,it,without,and,The,that,at,After,a,the,to,the,of,the,for,several,if,the,to,the,But,when,the,that,and,the,that,the,at,The,The,After,the,the,the,to,with,its,The,at,After,the,its,the,the,to,its,the,The,for,a,of,at,The,that,the,a,that,the,because,he,The,with,the,that,and,that,the,in,to,a,The,on,the,and,It,by,that,at,But,it,that,under,this,the,into,whether,at,at,it,the,whether,a,at,at,the,and,therefore,because,at,And,because,the,the,at,the,the,that,the,at,she,its,that,in,of,at,She,that,under,the,the,at,to,if,so,the,in,a,that,the,his,Our,to,each,A,few,if,any,of,than,the,that,at,at,Our,of,this,in,which,the,of,a,that,until,the,of,the,As,in,which,at,But,any,to,Its,at,The,our,in,that,the,of,the,anything,other,than,a,at,which,It,on,that,to,Under,the,the,whether,a,as,a,at,But,a,to,the,of,when,As,to,that,it,the,as,every,other,when,and,in,a,that,at,a,to,the,whether,i,at,the,that,upon,the,of,a,to,the,which,the,as,The,But,it,to,the,of,in,which,we,to,in,a,whether,but,whether,the,in,which,it,by,the,By,the,that,at,the,of,a,at,And,to,the,the,about,when,a,The,for,it,into,what,we,as,a,A,and,when,the,We,the,by,the,that,where,under,the,of,a,the,at,of,to,because,the,in,his,however,at,The,whether,the,in,a,that,the,in,which,and,no,that,in,a,that,his,The,of,the,And,the,a,After,the,to,against,his,for,and,the,That,a,a,that,the,a,The,It,that,at,But,the,of,that,in,for,the,above,The,on,to,the,Under,our,however,that,it,on,at,at,at,as,in,and,the,because,the,at,at,at,And,because,the,The,by,the,to,to,or,to,the,On,the,of,the,of,the,of,a,It,that,to,the,to,its,It,the,a,of,for,the,at,And,the,the,on,the,of,that,it,before,the,the,that,the,it,from,the,in,the,of,and,for,before,the,When,the,to,its,the,or,that,the,of,the,when,it,after,The,the,of,the,but,it,to,our,and,to,the,by,the,The,for,to,in,and,the,for,a,of,The,of,the,of,and,the,for,with,this,It,so,of,that,to,and,his,the,These,in,the,of,the,that,to,this,where,the,or,where,a,by,or,The,of,any,Nor,we,a,where,the,no,to,the,to,the,of,the,if,the,to,the,or,a,than,for,a,the,bar,his,We,this,in,that,once,the,of,the,of,in,which,a,at",0,0.0,117,5.38,"certiorari,jurisdiction,trial,supra,brief,fraud,indictment,battery,appeal,verdict,conviction,mistrial,defendant,jury,prosecutor,writ,Clause,action,Supreme Court,guilty,acquittal,counsel,determination,statute,witness",57.44,0.81,7.46,0,2,5,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,10,0,0,0,0,4,2,1,4,8,1,0,1,0,2,0,3,186,28,2,1,0,8,1,5,0,0,4,0,2,0,0,1,1,0,1,0,0,4,0,11,6,0,0,1,0,0,0,46,2,0,1,0,40,0,0,0,38,0,0,0,1,23,51,8,1,0,1,7,2,1,0,0,7,0,0,6,0,0,6,3,3,1,6,0,0,39,4,0,3,0,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,12,13,2,0,0,0,0,0,45,0,0,3,0,0,1,0,14,0,0,19,1,4.667

Because rational people can sometimes disagree, the inevitable consequence of this settled law is that s will sometimes encounter s that they believe to be mistaken, but that they must nonetheless uphold. The Court of s in this case substituted its judgment for that of a California on the question whether the 's or the defense's expert witnesses more persuasively explained the cause of a death. For this reason, is granted and the judgment of the Court of s is reversed. This case concerns the death of -week-old Etzel Glass. On November , Etzel's mother, Tomeka, put Etzel to sleep on a sofa before going to sleep herself in another room. Shirley Ree Smith-Tomeka's mother slept on the floor next to Etzel. Several hours later, Smith ran into Tomeka's room, holding Etzel, who was limp, and told her that QUOTED TEXT Tr. By the time emergency officials arrived, Etzel was not breathing and had no heartbeat. Smith reported that she thought Etzel had fallen off the sofa. The officials' efforts to resuscitate Etzel failed. Doctors initially attributed Etzel's death to sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), the customary diagnosis when an infant shows no outward signs of trauma. But after an the concluded that the cause of death was instead shaken baby syndrome When a social worker informed Smith of that finding, Smith told her that Etzel had not responded to her touch while sleeping, so she had picked him up and given him QUOTED TEXT to wake him. According to the social worker, Smith then said something to the effect of, QUOTED TEXT Id., at (internal quotation marks omitted). In an interview with the police a few days later, Smith said that she had shaken Etzel, but then she corrected herself and said that she had twisted him to try to elicit a re Smith was arrested and charged with on a child resulting in death. See California Penal Code Annotation ab (West (QUOTED TEXT). At the heard seven days of expert medical on the cause of Etzel's death. The offered three experts, each of whom attested that Etzel's death was the result of SBS not SIDS, as the defense contended. The first expert, Dr. Eugene Carpenter, was the medical examiner for the Los Angeles County who had supervised Etzel's Dr. Carpenter is board certified in forensic, anatomic, and clinical pathology. He testified that Etzel's revealed recent hemorrhages in the brain, and he opined that the bleeding and other features of Etzel's pathology, including a bruise and abrasion on the lower back of the baby's head, were consistent with violent shaking. Dr. Carpenter identified two means by which shaking can result in a baby's death: The first is that the shaking causes blood vessels in the brain to tear, creating a pool of blood that pushes the brain downward into the spinal canal, resulting in death but little direct damage to the brain. The second is that the shaking itself is sufficiently severe that the brain directly tears in vital areas, causing death with very little bleeding. Dr. Carpenter testified that Etzel's injuries were consistent with the latter pathology. He also explained that the injuries could not be attributed to either a fall from the sofa or the administration of cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Nor, according to Dr. Carpenter, was it possible that Etzel perished from SIDS, given the signs of internal trauma. Dr. Carpenter did however, that while SBS victims often suffer retinal hemorrhaging, Etzel's revealed no such in The 's second expert, Dr. Stephanie Erlich, was the associate deputy medical examiner who actually performed Etzel's She is board certified in anatomic pathology and neuropathology. She corroborated Dr. Carpenter's about the findings, and added that a followup neuropathological examination of Etzel's brain confirmed the existence of recent hemorrhaging. Noting only a minimal amount of new blood in Etzel's brain, she testified that the cause of death was direct trauma to the brainstem. On cross-examination, she agreed with defense that retinal hemorrhaging (absent in Etzel's case) is present in to percent of SBS cases. The third expert, Dr. David Chadwick, is board certified in pediatrics and the author of on childhood death by abusive trauma. He testified that Etzel's injuries were consistent with SBS and that old trauma could not have been the cause of the child's death. The defense called two experts to dispute these conclusions. The first, pathologist Dr. Richard Siegler, testified that Etzel died from brain trauma, but that it was not the result of SBS, given the lack of retinal hemorrhaging. He admitted on cross-examination, however, that an absence of retinal hemorrhaging does not exclude a finding of SBS. He also acknowledged that he did not believe the cause of Etzel's death was SIDS. According to Dr. Siegler, Etzel died from old trauma, an opinion he reached on the basis of studying photographs of the neuropathological examination. The other defense expert, pediatric neurologist Dr. William Goldie, testified that Etzel's death was due to SIDS. He noted that Etzel was born with jaundice, a heart murmur, and low birth weight-making him more susceptible to SIDS. Dr. Goldie testified that pathologists had not been able to de ine the cause of Etzel's death and that the bleeding could be attributed to the resuscitation efforts. The found Smith Concluding that the QUOTED TEXT the QUOTED TEXT supporting the Tr. the denied Smith's motion for a new and sentenced her to an inde inate of years to life in prison. On direct review, Smith contended that the evidence was not sufficient to establish that Etzel died from SBS. After thoroughly reviewing the competing medical the California Court of rejected this concluding: QUOTED TEXT People versus Smith, Number B118869 (Feb. ), Application to Petition for The California denied review. Smith then filed this petition for a of habeas with the United States District Court for the Central District of California, renewing her that the evidence was insufficient to prove that Etzel died of stocktickerSBS. that court had no power to afford relief unless Smith could show either that the California Court of 's decision affirming the QUOTED TEXT clearly established federal law as reflected in the holdings of this Court's cases, U.S.C. ), or that it QUOTED TEXT in light of the state court record, ). The to whom the case was assigned issued a report acknowledging that QUOTED TEXT and that the evidence against Smith QUOTED TEXT Application I to Petition for But the nevertheless concluded that the evidence was QUOTED TEXT Ibid. The District Court adopted the 's report and denied the petition. On the Ninth reversed with instructions to grant the Despite the plentitude of expert in the record concluding that sudden shearing or tearing of the brainstem was the cause of Etzel's death, the Ninth de ined that there was QUOTED TEXT on that question because there was QUOTED TEXT Id., at The court said that the State's experts QUOTED TEXT Ibid. The court concluded that because QUOTED TEXT ibid., the California Court of had QUOTED TEXT this Court's opinion in Jackson versus irginia in upholding Smith's Federal d, at That conclusion was plainly wrong. Jackson says that evidence is sufficient to support a so long as QUOTED TEXT U.S. at It also unambiguously instructs that a reviewing court QUOTED TEXT Id., at When the deference to state court decisions required by is applied to the state court's already deferential review, see Renico, U.S. at (slip opinion, at ), there can be no doubt of the Ninth 's error below. The was presented with competing views of how Etzel died. It was made aware of the various experts' qualifications and their familiarity with both the subject of SBS and the physical condition of Etzel's body. It observed the attorneys for each party the experts and elicit concessions from them. The State's experts, whom the was entitled to believe, opined that the physical evidence was consistent with, and best explained by, death from sudden tearing of the brainstem caused by shaking. The Ninth 's assertion that these experts QUOTED TEXT is simply false. There was QUOTED TEXT The revealed indications of recent trauma to Etzel's brain, such as subdural and subarachnoid hemorrhaging, hemorrhaging around the optic nerves, and the presence of a blood clot between the brain's hemispheres. The also revealed a bruise and abrasion on the lower back of Etzel's head. These affirmative indications of trauma formed the basis of the experts' opinion that Etzel died from shaking so severe that his brainstem tore. Defense made certain that the understood that the 's experts were unable to identify the precise point of tearing itself. But as Bea noted in his dissent from the Ninth 's denial of rehearing en banc, the experts explained why the location of the tear was undetectable: QUOTED TEXT Smith versus Mitchell, Federal ). According to the s' experts, there was simply no opportunity for swelling to occur around the brainstem before Etzel died. In light of the evidence presented at the Ninth plainly erred in concluding that the 's was irrational, let alone that it was unreasonable for the California Court of to think otherwise. See Doubts about whether Smith is in fact are understandable. But it is not the job of this Court, and was not that of the Ninth to decide whether the State's theory was correct. The decided that question, and its decision is supported by the record. It is said that Smith, who already has served years in prison, has been punished enough, and that she poses no danger to society. These or other considerations perhaps would be grounds to seek clemency, a prerogative granted to executive authorities to help ensure that justice is tempered by mercy. It is not clear to the Court whether this process has been invoked, or, if so, what its course has been. It is not for the Judicial Branch to de ine the standards for this discretion. If the clemency power is exercised in either too generous or too stingy a way, that calls for political correctives, not judicial intervention. The decision below cannot be allowed to stand. This Court vacated and ed this judgment twice before, calling the 's attention to this Court's opinions highlighting the necessity of deference to state courts in habeas cases. Each time the persisted in its course, reinstating its judgment without seriously confronting the significance of the cases called to its attention. See Patrick versus Smith, country regionU. S. (vacating and ing in light of Carey versus Musladin, country regionU. S. )), reinstated on Federal (per curiam); U.S. (vacating and ing in light of McDaniel versus Brown, placecountry regionU. S.

The judgment of the Court of s for the Ninth is reversed, and the case is ed for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ordered. The dissent's review of the evidence presented to the over seven days is precisely the sort of reweighing of facts that is precluded by Jackson versus irginia, U.S. ), and precisely the sort of second-guessing of a state court decision applying Jackson that is precluded by AEDPA, The dissent's views on how QUOTED TEXT experts would today as opposed to at the time of post, at (opinion of Ginsburg, J.), are of course pure speculation, as would be any views on how a would react to less adamant .",13328,2166,96,22.41,11.48,660,47.14,752,"The,of,the,in,that,it,the,of,the,the,to,what,from,at,A,the,on,the,of,if,no,of,with,the,What,a,a,a,of,the,because,the,with,the,The,so,if,the,at,Because,the,of,this,that,that,they,to,but,that,they,The,of,in,this,its,for,that,of,a,on,the,whether,the,or,the,the,of,a,For,this,and,the,of,the,of,This,the,of,On,to,on,a,before,to,in,another,on,the,to,Several,into,who,and,her,that,By,the,and,no,that,she,off,the,The,to,to,the,when,no,of,But,after,the,that,the,of,When,a,of,that,her,that,to,her,while,so,she,up,and,to,to,the,something,to,the,of,at,In,with,the,a,few,that,she,but,she,and,that,she,to,to,a,and,with,on,a,in,At,the,of,on,the,of,The,each,of,whom,that,the,of,as,the,The,the,for,the,who,in,and,He,that,in,the,and,he,that,the,and,other,of,a,and,on,the,of,the,with,by,which,in,a,The,that,the,in,the,to,a,of,that,the,into,the,in,but,to,the,The,that,the,that,the,in,with,that,with,the,He,that,the,to,either,a,from,the,or,the,of,Nor,to,it,that,from,the,of,however,that,while,no,The,the,who,She,in,and,She,about,the,and,that,a,of,the,of,a,of,in,she,that,the,of,to,the,On,she,with,that,in,in,to,of,The,in,and,the,of,on,by,He,that,with,and,that,the,of,the,The,to,these,The,that,from,but,that,it,the,of,the,of,He,on,however,that,of,a,of,He,that,he,the,of,to,from,he,on,the,of,of,the,The,other,that,to,He,that,with,a,and,to,that,to,the,of,and,that,the,to,the,The,that,the,the,the,the,for,a,and,her,to,of,to,in,On,that,the,to,that,from,After,the,the,of,this,to,for,The,this,for,a,of,with,the,for,the,of,her,that,the,to,that,of,that,no,to,unless,either,that,the,of,the,as,in,the,of,this,or,that,it,in,of,the,The,to,whom,the,a,that,and,that,the,against,I,to,for,But,the,that,the,The,the,and,the,On,the,with,to,the,the,of,in,the,that,or,of,the,the,of,the,that,on,that,because,at,The,that,the,The,that,because,the,of,this,in,in,at,That,that,to,a,so,as,at,It,that,a,at,When,the,to,by,to,the,at,at,no,of,the,below,The,with,of,It,of,the,and,their,with,both,the,of,and,the,of,It,the,for,each,the,and,from,The,whom,the,to,that,the,with,and,by,from,of,the,by,The,that,these,The,of,to,as,and,around,the,and,the,of,a,between,the,The,a,and,on,the,of,These,of,the,of,the,that,from,so,that,his,that,the,that,the,to,the,of,But,as,in,his,from,the,of,the,the,of,the,to,the,no,for,to,around,the,before,In,of,the,at,the,in,that,the,that,it,for,the,of,to,about,whether,in,But,it,the,of,this,and,that,of,the,to,whether,the,The,that,and,its,by,the,It,that,who,in,and,that,she,no,to,These,or,other,to,a,to,to,that,by,It,to,the,whether,this,or,if,so,what,its,It,for,the,to,the,for,this,If,the,in,either,or,a,that,for,The,below,to,This,and,this,before,the,to,this,the,of,to,in,Each,the,in,its,its,without,the,of,the,to,its,and,in,of,on,per,and,in,of,per,on,Its,to,so,this,The,for,a,of,and,to,in,The,of,the,of,for,the,and,the,for,with,this,It,so,The,of,the,to,the,over,the,of,of,that,by,and,the,of,of,a,that,by,The,on,as,to,at,the,of,at,of,of,as,any,on,a,to,less",0,0.0,101,4.66,"claim,habeas corpus,certiorari,Judge,trial,Magistrate,testify,articles,appeal,cross-examine,verdict,autopsy,conviction,Respondent,judge,coroner,jury,respondent,writ,action,prosecution,remand,Coroner,Supreme Court,assault,guilty,counsel,Certiorari,testimony,panel,corpus,term,Appeal,Circuit,Court of Appeal",68.2,0.83,8.17,1,0,16,2,2,0,1,9,0,0,0,0,4,0,1,0,1,4,1,3,1,7,10,0,1,0,1,1,3,176,33,4,3,0,4,2,0,0,0,8,0,0,0,5,0,0,0,1,1,0,7,0,7,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,71,10,0,3,1,35,0,0,2,13,0,0,0,0,13,59,1,1,0,0,10,2,0,0,0,2,4,0,7,0,0,2,0,1,1,0,0,0,85,0,1,3,0,0,0,16,0,2,0,0,0,8,20,0,0,0,0,0,0,31,0,3,2,0,0,0,0,3,0,0,17,1,4.835
case-572-650,unknown," During the early morning hours of New Year's Eve, police sergeant Jeffrey Cotton fired three bullets at Robert Tolan; one of those bullets hit its target and punctured Tolan's right lung. At the time of the shooting, Tolan was unarmed on his parents' front porch about to feet away from Cotton. Tolan sued, alleging that Cotton had exercised excessive force in violation of the Fourth Amendment. The District Court granted summary judgment to Cotton, and the Fifth affirmed, reasoning that regardless of whether Cotton used excessive force, he was entitled to qualified immunity because he did not violate any clearly established right. In articulating the factual context of the case, the Fifth failed to adhere to the axiom that in ruling on a motion for summary judgment, QUOTED TEXT Anderson versus Liberty Lobby, Inc., U.S. For that reason, we vacate its decision and the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. A The following facts, which we view in the light most favorable to Tolan, are taken from the record evidence and the opinions below. At around on the morning of December , John Edwards, a police officer, was on patrol in Bellaire, Texas, when he noticed a black Nissan sport utility vehicle turning quickly onto a residential street. The officer watched the vehicle park on the side of the street in front of a house. Two men exited: Tolan and his cousin, Anthony Cooper. Edwards attempted to enter the license plate number of the vehicle into a computer in his squad car. But he keyed an incorrect character; instead of entering plate number BGK, he entered BGK. That incorrect number matched a stolen vehicle of the same color and make. This match caused the squad car's computer to send an automatic message to other police units, informing them that Edwards had found a stolen vehicle. Edwards exited his cruiser, drew his service pistol and ed Tolan and Cooper to the ground. He Tolan and Cooper of having stolen the car. Cooper responded, QUOTED TEXT Record And Tolan explained, QUOTED TEXT Ibid. Tolan then complied with the officer's demand to lie face-down on the home's front porch. As it turned out, Tolan and Cooper were at the home where Tolan lived with his parents. Hearing the commotion, Tolan's parents exited the front door in their pajamas. In an attempt to keep the misunderstanding from escalating into something more, Tolan's father instructed Cooper to lie down, and instructed Tolan and Cooper to say nothing. Tolan and Cooper then remained facedown. Edwards told Tolan's parents that he believed Tolan and Cooper had stolen the vehicle. In response, Tolan's father identified Tolan as his son, and Tolan's mother explained that the vehicle belonged to the family and that no crime had been committed. Tolan's father explained, with his hands in the air, QUOTED TEXT Id., at Tolan's mother similarly offered, QUOTED TEXT Id., at While Tolan and Cooper continued to lie on the ground in silence, Edwards radioed for assistance. Shortly thereafter, Sergeant Jeffrey Cotton arrived on the scene and drew his pistol. Edwards told Cotton that Cooper and Tolan had exited a stolen vehicle. Tolan's mother reiterated that she and her husband owned both the car Tolan had been driving and the home where these events were unfolding. Cotton then ed her to stand against the family's garage door. In response to Cotton's Tolan's mother asked, QUOTED TEXT Id., at see also id., at The parties disagree as to what happened next. Tolan's mother and Cooper testified during Cotton's criminal that Cotton grabbed her arm and slammed her against the garage door with such force that she fell to the ground. Tolan similarly testified that Cotton pushed his mother against the garage door. In addition, Tolan offered from his mother and photographic evidence to demonstrate that Cotton used enough force to leave bruises on her arms and back that lasted for days. By contrast, Cotton testified in his that when he was escorting the mother to the garage, she flipped her arm up and told him to get his hands off her. He also testified that he did not know whether he left bruises but believed that he had not. The parties also dispute the manner in which Tolan responded. Tolan testified in his and during the criminal that upon seeing his mother being pushed, id., at he rose to his knees, id., at Edwards and Cotton testified that Tolan rose to his feet. Both parties agree that Tolan then exclaimed, from roughly to feet away, Federal d, at QUOTED TEXT Record The parties also agree that Cotton then drew his pistol and fired three shots at Tolan. Tolan and his mother testified that these shots came with no verbal warning. One of the bullets entered Tolan's chest, collapsing his right lung and piercing his liver. While Tolan survived, he suffered a life-altering in that disrupted his budding professional baseball career and causes him to experience pain on a daily basis. In May Cooper, Tolan, and Tolan's parents filed this in the Southern District of Texas, alleging claims under Review U.S.C. Tolan claimed, among other things, that Cotton had used excessive force against him in violation of the Fourth Amendment. After Cotton moved for summary judgment, arguing that the doctrine of qualified immunity barred the That doctrine immunizes government officials from s unless their conduct has violated a clearly established right. The District Court granted summary judgment to Cotton. It reasoned that Cotton's use of force was not unreasonable and therefore did not violate the Fourth Amendment. The Fifth affirmed, but on a different basis. It declined to decide whether Cotton's s violated the Fourth Amendment. Instead, it held that even if Cotton's conduct did violate the Fourth Amendment, Cotton was entitled to qualified immunity because he did not violate a clearly established right. In reaching this conclusion, the Fifth began by noting that at the time Cotton shot Tolan, QUOTED TEXT Id., at (quoting Deville versus Marcantel, Federal (CA5 )). The Courtof Appeals reasoned that Tolan failed to overcome the qualified-immunity bar because QUOTED TEXT that Tolan QUOTED TEXT Federal d, at ] In support of this conclusion, the court relied on the following facts: the front porch had been QUOTED TEXT; Tolan's mother had QUOTED TEXT; and Tolan's words had amounted to a QUOTED TEXT Ibid. Most critically, the court also relied on the purported fact that Tolan was QUOTED TEXT Cotton's handling of his mother, id., at and that Cotton therefore could reasonably have feared for his life, id., at , the court held, Cotton did not violate clearly established law in shooting Tolan. The Fifth denied rehearing en banc. Three judges voted to grant rehearing.

In cases alleging unreasonable searches or seizures, we have instructed that courts should define the QUOTED TEXT right at issue on the basis of the QUOTED TEXT Saucier, at see also Anderson versus Creighton, U.S. ). courts must take care not to define a case's QUOTED TEXT in a manner that imports genuinely disputed factual propositions. See Brosseau, at (inquiring as to whether conduct violated clearly established law QUOTED TEXT and construing QUOTED TEXT the nonmovant). In holding that Cotton's s did not violate clearly established law, the Fifth failed to view the evidence at summary judgment in the light most favorable to Tolan with respect to the central facts of this case. By failing to credit evidence that contradicted some of its key factual conclusions, the court improperly QUOTED TEXT and resolved disputed issues in favor of the moving party, Anderson, U.S. at First, the court relied on its view that at the time of the shooting, the Tolans' front porch was QUOTED TEXT Federal d, at The court appears to have drawn this assessment from Cotton's statements in a that when he fired at Tolan, the porch was QUOTED TEXT and lit by a gas lamp that was QUOTED TEXT Id., at In his own however, Tolan's father was asked whether the gas lamp was in fact QUOTED TEXT Record He said that it was not. Moreover, Tolan stated in his that two floodlights shone on the driveway during the incident, id.,at and Cotton acknowledged that there were two motion-activated lights in front of the house. And Tolan confirmed that at the time of the shooting, he was QUOTED TEXT Id., at Second, the Fifth stated that Tolan's mother QUOTED TEXT thereby QUOTED TEXT Cotton's belief that Tolan QUOTED TEXT Federal d, at (internal quotation marks omitted). But here, too, the court did not credit directly contradictory evidence. Although the parties agree that Tolan's mother repeatedly informed officers that Tolan was her son, that she lived in the home in front of which he had parked, and that the vehicle he had been driving belonged to her and her husband, there is a dispute as to how calmly she provided this information. Cotton stated during his that Tolan's mother was QUOTED TEXT when she spoke to the officers. By contrast, Tolan's mother testified at Cotton's criminal that she was neither QUOTED TEXT nor QUOTED TEXT Id., at . Third, the Court concluded that Tolan was QUOTED TEXT Federal d, at , and QUOTED TEXT the officer, id., at in the moments before the shooting. The court noted, and the parties agree, that while Cotton was grabbing the arm of his mother, Tolan told Cotton, QUOTED TEXT Record But Tolan testified that he QUOTED TEXT Id., at And a could reasonably infer that his words, in context, did not amount to a statement of intent to inflict harm. Compare United States versus White, Federal (CA5 (QUOTED TEXT (quoting Black's Law Dictionary th edition ))); Morris versus Noe, Federal (CA10 (inferring that the words QUOTED TEXT did not constitute an QUOTED TEXT). Tolan's mother testified in Cotton's criminal that he slammed her against a garage door with enough force to cause bruising that lasted for days. A could well have concluded that a reasonable officer would have heard Tolan's words not as a threat, but as a son's not to continue any of his mother. Fourth, the Fifth inferred that at the time of the shooting, Tolan was QUOTED TEXT inter with his mother. Federal d, at305; see also id., at (characterizing Tolan's behavioras QUOTED TEXT thereby QUOTED TEXT). The court appears to have credited Edwards' account that at the time of the shooting, Tolan was on both feet QUOTED TEXT or a QUOTED TEXT looking as if he was going to move forward. Tolan testified at however, that he was on his knees when Cotton shot him, id., at a fact corroborated by his mother, id., at Tolan also testified in his that he QUOTED TEXT id., at and emphasized that he did not QUOTED TEXT id., at Considered together, these facts lead to the inescapable conclusion that the court below credited the evidence of the party seeking summary judgment and failed properly to acknowledge key evidence offered by the party opposing that motion. And while QUOTED TEXT Boag versus MacDougall U.S. (O'Connor, J., concurring), we intervene here because the opinion below reflects a clear misapprehension of summary judgment standards in light of our precedents. Compare Brosseau, U.S. at (summarily reversing decision in a Fourth Amendment excessive force case QUOTED TEXT); see also Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services versus Florida Nursing Home Association, U.S. (per curiam) (summarily reversing an opinion that could not QUOTED TEXT in this Court's sovereign immunity jurisprudence). The witnesses on both sides come to this case with their own perceptions, recollections, and even potential biases. It is in part for that reason that genuine disputes are generally resolved by juries in our adversarial system. By weighing the evidence and reaching factual inferences contrary to Tolan's competent evidence, the court below neglected to adhere to the fundamental principle that at the summary judgment stage, reasonable inferences should be drawn in favor of the nonmoving party. Applying that principle here, the court should have acknowledged and credited Tolan's evidence with regardto the lighting, his mother's demeanor, whether he shouted words that were an overt threat, and his positioningduring the shooting. This is not to say, of course, that these are the only facts that the Fifth should consider, or that no other facts might contribute to the reasonableness of the officer's s as a matter of law. Nor do we express a view as to whether Cotton's s violated clearly established law. We instead vacate the Fifth 's judgment so that the court can determine whether, when Tolan's evidence is properly credited and factual inferences are reasonably drawn in his favor, Cotton's s violated clearly established law. The petition for and the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund's motion to file an amicus curiae are granted. The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth is vacated, and the case is ed for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ed. The events described here led to Cotton's criminal in Harris County, Texas, for aggravated by a public servant. He was acquitted. The of Tolan's mother during Cotton's is a part of the record in this civil The complaint also alleged that the officers' s violated the Equal Protection to the extent they were motivated by Tolan's and Cooper's race. In addition, the complaint alleged that Cotton used excessive force against Tolan's mother. Those claims, which were dismissed, at , are not before this Court. Tolan argues that the Fifth incorrectly analyzed the reasonableness of Sergeant Cotton's beliefs under the second prong of the qualified-immunity analysis rather than the first. See Petition for .

case-565-388,unknown," The census showed an enormous increase in Texas' population, with over four million new residents. That growth required the State to redraw its electoral districts for the United States Congress, the State Senate, and the State House of Representatives, in to comply with the Constitution's one-person, one-vote rule. See Georgia versus Ashcroft, U.S. n. ). The State also had to create new districts for the four additional congressional seats it received. Texas is a QUOTED TEXT under Section of the oting Rights Act of See Section suspends all changes to a covered 's election procedures, including district lines, until those changes are submitted to and approved by a three- United States District Court for the District of Columbia, or the General. See Northwest Austin Municipal Utility District Number One versus Holder, U.S. This process, known as preclearance, requires the covered to demonstrate that its proposed change QUOTED TEXT c(a). This Court has been emphatic that a new electoral map cannot be used to conduct an election until it has been precleared. See, e.g., Clark versus Roemer, U.S. The day after completing its new electoral plans, Texas submitted them to the United States District Court for the District of Columbia for preclearance. The preclearance process remains ongoing. Texas was unsuccessful in its bid for summary judgment, and a is scheduled in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, various plaintiffs-appellees here brought in Texas, ing that the State's newly enacted plans violate the United States Constitution and of the oting Rights Act. Appellees alleged, inter alia, that Texas' enacted plans discriminate against Latinos and African-Americans and dilute their voting strength, notwithstanding the fact that Latinos and African-Americans accounted for three-quarters of Texas' population growth since A three- of the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas was convened. See U.S.C. That court heard argument and held a with respect to the plaintiffs' s, but withheld judgment pending of the preclearance process in the D.C. court. Compare Branch versus Smith, U.S. (Kennedy, J., concurring). As Texas' primaries approached, it became increasingly likely that the State's newly enacted plans would not receive preclearance in time for the elections. And the State's old district lines could not be used, because population growth had rendered them inconsistent with the Constitution's one-person, one-vote requirement. It thus fell to the District Court in Texas to devise interim plans for the State's primaries and elections. See Connor versus Finch, U.S. ). After proposals from the parties and holding extensive hearings, that court issued its interim plans. The court unanimously agreed on an interim State Senate plan, but Smith dissented with respect to the congressional and State House plans. Texas asked this Court to stay the interim plans pending an arguing that they were unnecessarily inconsistent with the State's enacted plans. This Court granted the stay and noted probable Redistricting is QUOTED TEXT Chapman versus Meier, U.S. The failure of a State's newly enacted plan to gain preclearance prior to an upcoming election does not, by itself, require a court to take up the state legislature's task. That is because, in most circumstances, the State's last enacted plan simply remains in effect until the new plan receives preclearance. But if an intervening event most commonly, as here, a census renders the current plan unusable, a court must undertake the QUOTED TEXT of creating an interim plan. Even then, the plan already in effect may give sufficient structure to the court's endeavor. Where shifts in a State's population have been relatively small, a court may need to make only or obvious adjustments to the State's existing districts in to devise an interim plan. But here the scale of Texas' population growth appears to require sweeping changes to the State's current districts. In areas where population shifts are so large that no semblance of the existing plan's district lines can be used, that plan offers little guidance to a court drawing an interim map. The problem is perhaps most obvious in adding new congressional districts: The old plan gives no suggestion as to where those new districts should be placed. In addition, experience has shown the difficulty of defining neutral legal principles in this area, for redistricting ordinarily involves criteria and standards that have been weighed and evaluated by the elected branches in the exercise of their political judgment. See, e.g., Miller versus Johnson, U.S. ); White versus Weiser, U.S. ). Thus, if the old state districts were the only source to which a district court could look, it would be forced to make the sort of policy judgments for which courts are, at best, ill ed. To avoid being compelled to make such otherwise standardless decisions, a district court should take guidance from the State's recently enacted plan in drafting an interim plan. That plan reflects the State's policy judgments on where to place new districts and how to shift existing ones in response to massive population growth. This Court has observed before that QUOTED TEXT a state plan even one that was itself unenforceable-QUOTED TEXT Abrams versus Johnson, U.S. (holding that the District Court properly declined to defer to a precleared plan that used race as a predominant factor). For example, in White, an equal population challenge, this Court reversed a District Court's choice of interim plan, and required the District Court to choose a plan more closely resembling an enacted state plan, even though the state plan itself had been held to violate the one-person, one-vote principle. Similarly, in Upham versus Seamon, although the state plan as a whole had been denied preclearance, this Court directed a District Court to QUOTED TEXT insofar as they involved districts found to meet the preclearance standard. See also Whitcomb versus Chavis, U.S. (equal protection challenge). Section prevents a state plan from being implemented if it has not been precleared. But that does not mean that the plan is of no account or that the policy judgments it reflects can be disregarded by a district court drawing an interim plan. On the contrary, the state plan serves as a starting point for the district court. It provides important guidance that helps ensure that the district court appropriately confines itself to drawing interim maps that comply with the Constitution and the oting Rights Act, without displacing legitimate state policy judgments with the court's own preferences. A district court making such use of a State's plan must, of course, take care not to incorporate into the interim plan any legal defects in the state plan. See Abrams, at White, at Where a State's plan faces challenges under the Constitution or of the oting Rights Act, a district court should still be guided by that plan, except to the extent those legal challenges are shown to have a likelihood of success on the merits. Plaintiffs seeking a preliminary injunction of a must normally demonstrate that they are likely to succeed on the merits of their challenge to that law. See Winter versus Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., U.S. There is no reason that plaintiffs seeking to defeat the policies behind a State's redistricting legislation should not also have to meet that standard. And because the local district court here, the District Court for the Western District of Texas will ultimately decide the merits of s under and the Constitution, it is well equipped to apply that familiar standard. The calculus with respect to challenges is somewhat different. Where a State has sought preclearance in the District Court for the District of Columbia, allows only that court to determine whether the state plan complies with Consistent with that design, we have made clear that other district courts may not address the merits of challenges. See, e.g., Perkins versus Matthews, U.S. The local district court drafting an interim plan must therefore be careful not to pre the merits of the preclearance proceedings. The court should presume neither that a State's effort to preclear its plan will succeed nor that it will fail. The need to avoid prejudging the merits of preclearance is satisfied by taking guidance from a State's policy judgments unless they reflect aspects of the state plan that stand a reasonable probability of failing to gain preclearance. And by QUOTED TEXT this Court means in this context that the challenge is not insubstantial. That standard ensures that a district court is not deprived of important guidance provided by a state plan due to challenges that have no reasonable probability of success but still respects the and prerogative of those responsible for the preclearance And the reasonable probability standard adequately balances the unique preclearance scheme with the State's sovereignty and a district court's need for policy guidance in constructing an interim map. This Court recently noted the QUOTED TEXT raised by 's intrusion on state sovereignty. Those concerns would only be exacerbated if required a district court to wholly ignore the State's policies in drawing maps that will govern a State's elections, without any reason to believe those state policies are unlawful. Appellees, however, contend that demands exactly that. In their view, this Court's precedents require district courts to ignore any state plan that has not received preclearance. But the cases upon which appellees rely hold only that a district court may not adopt an unprecleared plan as its own. See Lopez versus Monterey County, U.S. McDaniel versus Sanchez, U.S. They say nothing about whether a district court may take guidance from the lawful policies incorporated in such a plan for aid in drawing an interim map. Indeed, in Upham this Court ed a District Court to defer to the unobjectionable aspects of a State's plan even though that plan had already been denied preclearance. In this case, the District Court stated that it had QUOTED TEXT Application At the same time, however, the court said that it was required to draw an QUOTED TEXT following QUOTED TEXT Id., at In the court's view, it QUOTED TEXT and it instead applied principles that it determined QUOTED TEXT Id., at To the extent the District Court exceeded its mission to draw interim maps that do not violate the Constitution or the oting Rights Act, and substituted its own concept of QUOTED TEXT for the Texas Legislature's of which policies serve QUOTED TEXT the court erred. In pro ing its ability to draw an interim map QUOTED TEXT the District Court relied heavily on Balderas versus Texas, Number cv158, U.S. District LEXIS (ED Texas, Nov. ) (per curiam), summarily aff'd, U.S. Application But in Balderas there was no recently enacted state plan to which the District Court could turn. Without the benefit of legislative guidance in making distinctly legislative policy judgments, the Balderas court was perhaps compelled to design an interim map based on its own notion of the public good. Because the District Court here had the benefit of a recently enacted plan to assist it, the court had neither the need nor the license to cast aside that vital aid. Some specific aspects of the District Court's plans seem to pay adequate attention to the State's policies, others do not, and the propriety of still others is unclear. For example, in drawing State House districts in North and East Texas, the District Court closely followed the State's policies. See Application id., at Although Texas' entire State House plan is challenged in the proceedings, there is apparently no serious that the district lines in North and East Texas have a discriminatory intent or effect. The District Court was thus correct to take guidance from the State's plan in drawing the interim map for those regions. But the court then altered those districts to achieve de minimis population variations even though there was no that the population variations in those districts were unlawful. In the absence of any legal flaw in this respect in the State's plan, the District Court had no basis to modify that plan. The District Court also erred in refusing to split voting precincts (called QUOTED TEXT in Texas) in drawing the interim plans. That choice alone prevented the District Court from following the lead of Texas' enacted plan which freely splits precincts in many areas where there were no legal challenges to the plan's details. See id., at , n. The District Court was apparently motivated by a well-intentioned desire to save Texas the time and expense of reconfiguring precincts, and to ensure that the court's interim plan could be implemented in time for the upcoming election. But the State's plan accepted the costs of splitting precincts in to accomplish other goals, and Texas law expressly allows recasting precincts when redistricting. See Texas Elec. If a State has chosen to accept the burden of changing its precincts, and its decision to do so is otherwise lawful, there is no for a district court to ignore the State's decision. Of course, in this case it may well be that Texas will reexamine this issue in light of the exigencies caused by the impending election. The District Court also appears to have unnecessarily ignored the State's plans in drawing certain individual districts. For example, the District Court drew an interim District that resembles neither the State's newly enacted plan, nor the previous plan in effect prior to the census. The court said that it did so in response to alleged constitutional violations. But the court did not say that those s were plausible, much less likely to succeed. Nor did the District Court rely on a finding that the relevant aspects of the state plan stood a reasonable probability of failing to gain preclearance, see at Without such a the District Court had no basis for drawing a district that does not resemble any legislatively enacted plan. The court's approach in drawing other districts was unclear. The interim plan's Congressional District for example, disregards aspects of the State's plan that appear to be subject to strong challenges in the proceeding. See id., at id., at That much seems appropriate, but there are grounds for concern with the path the District Court followed from there. The court's suggests that it may have intentionally drawn District as a QUOTED TEXT in which the court expected two different ity groups to band together to form an electoral majority. The is somewhat ambiguous on this point some portions suggest that the court deliberately designed such a district, other parts suggest that it drew the district solely as a response to population growth in the area. Compare id., at (QUOTED TEXT), with id., at (QUOTED TEXT). If the District Court did set out to create a ity coalition district, rather than drawing a district that simply reflected population growth, it had no basis for doing so. Compare Bartlett versus Strickland, U.S. (plurality opinion). Because it is unclear whether the District Court for the Western District of Texas followed the appropriate standards in drawing interim maps for the Texas elections, the s implementing those maps are vacated, and the cases are remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. The judgment shall issue forthwith. It is so ed. Notes Section prohibits QUOTED TEXT from imposing any electoral practice QUOTED TEXT U.S.C. This Court has stated that court-drawn maps are held to a higher standard of acceptable population variation than legislatively enacted maps. See, e.g., Abrams versus Johnson, U.S. But this Court has also explained that those QUOTED TEXT are not triggered where a district court incorporates unchallenged portions of a State's map into an interim map.",16809,2728,118,23.03,10.64,727,45.78,895,"The,in,with,over,That,the,to,its,for,the,the,and,the,of,in,to,with,the,one,one,The,to,for,the,it,a,under,of,the,of,all,to,a,until,those,to,and,by,a,for,the,of,or,the,One,This,as,the,to,that,its,This,that,a,to,until,it,The,after,its,to,the,for,the,of,for,The,in,its,for,and,a,in,the,in,that,the,the,and,of,the,that,against,and,and,their,the,that,and,for,of,since,A,of,the,for,the,of,That,and,a,with,to,the,but,of,the,in,the,As,it,that,the,in,for,the,And,the,because,with,the,one,one,It,thus,to,the,in,to,for,the,and,After,from,the,and,that,its,The,on,but,with,to,the,and,this,to,the,that,they,with,the,This,the,and,The,of,a,to,to,by,a,to,up,the,That,because,in,the,in,until,the,But,if,as,a,the,a,the,of,the,in,to,the,Where,in,a,a,to,or,to,the,in,to,But,the,of,to,to,the,In,where,so,that,no,of,the,that,to,a,The,in,The,no,as,to,where,those,In,the,of,in,this,for,and,that,and,by,the,in,the,of,their,Thus,if,the,the,to,which,a,it,to,the,of,for,which,at,To,to,a,from,the,in,That,the,on,where,to,and,to,in,to,This,before,that,a,one,that,that,the,to,to,a,that,as,a,For,in,this,a,of,and,the,to,a,though,the,to,the,one,one,in,although,the,as,a,this,a,to,as,they,to,the,a,from,if,it,But,that,that,the,of,no,or,that,the,it,by,a,On,the,the,as,a,for,the,It,that,that,the,to,that,with,the,and,the,without,with,the,A,of,a,of,to,into,the,any,in,the,at,at,Where,a,under,the,or,of,the,a,by,that,except,to,the,those,to,a,of,on,the,a,of,a,that,they,to,on,the,of,their,to,that,no,that,to,the,behind,a,to,that,And,because,the,the,for,the,of,the,of,under,and,the,it,to,that,The,with,to,Where,a,in,the,for,the,of,that,to,whether,the,with,with,that,we,that,other,the,of,The,therefore,to,the,of,the,The,neither,that,a,to,its,nor,that,it,The,to,the,of,by,from,a,unless,they,of,the,that,a,of,to,And,by,this,in,this,that,the,That,that,a,of,by,a,to,that,no,of,but,the,and,of,those,for,the,And,the,the,with,the,and,a,for,in,This,the,by,on,Those,if,a,to,the,in,that,a,without,any,to,those,however,that,that,In,their,this,to,any,that,But,the,upon,which,that,a,as,its,They,nothing,about,whether,a,from,the,in,a,for,in,in,this,a,to,to,the,of,a,though,that,In,this,the,that,it,At,the,however,the,that,it,to,at,In,the,it,and,it,that,it,at,To,the,the,its,to,that,the,or,the,and,its,of,for,the,of,which,the,In,its,to,the,on,per,But,in,no,to,which,the,Without,the,of,in,the,to,on,its,of,the,Because,the,the,of,a,to,it,the,neither,the,nor,the,to,that,Some,of,the,to,to,the,and,the,of,For,in,in,and,the,the,i,at,Although,in,the,no,that,the,in,and,a,or,The,thus,to,from,the,in,the,for,those,But,the,those,to,though,no,that,the,in,those,In,the,of,any,in,this,in,the,the,no,to,that,The,in,to,in,in,the,That,the,from,the,of,which,in,many,where,no,to,the,i,at,The,by,a,to,save,the,and,of,and,to,that,the,in,for,the,But,the,the,of,in,to,other,and,when,If,a,to,the,of,its,and,its,to,so,no,for,a,to,the,Of,in,this,it,that,this,in,of,the,by,the,The,to,the,in,For,the,that,neither,the,nor,the,in,to,the,The,that,it,so,in,to,But,the,that,those,less,to,Nor,the,on,a,that,the,of,the,a,of,to,at,Without,a,the,no,for,a,that,any,The,in,other,The,for,of,the,that,to,to,in,the,i,at,i,at,That,but,for,with,the,the,from,The,that,it,as,a,in,which,the,to,to,The,on,this,some,that,the,a,other,that,it,the,as,a,to,in,the,i,at,with,i,at,If,the,to,a,than,a,that,it,no,for,so,Because,it,whether,the,for,the,of,the,in,for,the,the,those,and,the,for,with,this,The,It,so,from,any,This,that,to,a,of,than,But,this,that,those,where,a,of,a,into",0,0.0,36,1.32,"claim,Judge,jurisdiction,allegation,trial,supra,Attorney,warrant,Attorney General,minority,order,appeal,suit,judge,receiving,determination,panel,Statute,statute,resolution,minor",74.25,0.82,8.24,4,0,21,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,5,0,0,0,0,6,1,0,6,11,9,0,4,0,0,0,1,193,61,0,0,0,3,1,3,0,1,13,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,12,5,8,13,0,0,5,0,0,0,0,71,0,0,0,1,34,3,0,0,13,3,0,0,0,23,91,7,4,0,1,11,2,0,0,0,0,0,1,6,0,0,2,2,1,0,1,2,3,57,8,1,4,0,1,0,15,0,0,0,0,0,13,10,3,0,0,0,0,2,65,0,0,2,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,32,6,4.989
case-571-263,unknown," In Strickland versus Washington, U.S. we held that a criminal 's Sixth Amendment right to is violated if his 's performance falls below an objective standard of reasonableness and if there is a reasonable probability that the result of the would have been different absent the deficient act or Anthony Ray Hinton, an inmate on Alabama's death row, asks us to decide whether the Alabama courts correctly applied Strickland to his case. We conclude that they did not and hold that Hinton's rendered constitutionally deficient performance. We vacate the lower court's judgment and the case for reconsideration of whether the 's deficient performance was prejudicial. A In February a restaurant manager in Birmingham was shot to death in the course of an after-hours of his restaurant. A second manager was murderedduraing a very similar of another restaurant inJuly. Then, later in July, a restaurant manager named Smotherman survived another similar -shooting. During each crime, the robber fired two caliber bullets; all six bullets were recovered by police investigators. Smotherman described his assailant to the police, and when the police showed him a photographic array, he picked out Hinton's picture. The police arrested Hinton and recovered from his house a caliber revolver belonging to his mother, who shared the house with him. After analyzing the six bullets fired during the three crimes and test-firing the revolver, examiners at the State's Department of Forensic Sciences concluded that the six bullets had all been fired fromthe same gun: the revolver found at Hinton's house. Hinton was charged with two counts of capital murder forthe killings during the first two robberies. He was not charged in connection with the third (that is, the Smotherman ). At the State's strategy was to link Hinton to the Smotherman through eye and forensic evidence about the bullets fired at Smotherman and then to persuade the that, in light of the similarity of the three crimes and forensic analysis of the bullets and the Hinton revolver, Hinton must also have committed the two murders. Smotherman identified Hinton as the man who robbed his restaurant and tried to kill him, and two other es provided that tended to link Hinton to the Smotherman Hinton maintained that he was innocent and that Smotherman had misidentified him. In support of that defense, Hinton presented es who testified in support of his that he was at work at a warehouse at the time of the Smotherman See Southern Reporterthern Reporter (Alabama (summarizing the evidence on each side of the case). The six bullets and the revolver were the only physical evidence. Besides those items, the police found no evidence at the crime scenes that could be used to identify the perpetrator (such as fingerprints) and no incriminating evidence at Hinton's home or in his car. The State's case turned on whether its expert es could convince the that the six recovered bullets had indeed been fired from the Hinton revolver. According to the Alabama QUOTED TEXT WL (Oct. ). The category of forensic evidence at issue in this case is QUOTED TEXT evidence. Toolmark examiners attempt to determine whether a bullet recovered from a crime scene was fired from a particular gun by comparing microscopic markings (toolmarks) on the recovered bullet to the markings on a bullet known to have been fired from that gun. The theory is that differences even between guns of the same model will leave discernible traces on bullets that are unique enough for an examiner to conclude that the recovered bullet was or was not fired from a given weapon. See generally National Research Council, Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States: Recognizing that Hinton's defense called for an effective rebuttal of the State's expert es, Hinton's filed a motion for funding to hire an expert of his own. In response, the granted with this statement: QUOTED TEXT WL (Alabama Criminal Application, Apr. ) (Cobb, J., dissenting) (quoting Tr. ). Hinton's did not take the up on his invitation to file a request for more funding.

But the relevant had been amended to provide: QUOTED TEXT See Dubose versus State, Southern Reporterthern Reporter , n.

That amendment went into effect on June , Dubose, at n. which was over a year before Hinton was arrested, so Hinton's could have corrected the 's mistaken belief that a limit applied and accepted his invitation to file a motion for additional funds. The failed to do so because he was himself unaware that Alabama law no longer imposed a specific limit and instead allowed reimbursement for QUOTED TEXT At an evidentiary hearing held on Hinton's postconviction petition, the following conversation occurred between a state and Hinton's QUOTED TEXT QUOTED TEXT QUOTED TEXT QUOTED TEXT QUOTED TEXT QUOTED TEXT QUOTED TEXT QUOTED TEXT Reporter's Official Tr. (emphasis added). Operating under the mistaken belief that he could pay no more than Hinton's went looking for an expert According to his postconviction he made an extensive search for a well-regarded expert, but found only one person who was willing to take the case for the pay he could Andrew Payne. As he told the during a pre hearing: QUOTED TEXT Id., at (internal quotation marks omitted). At Payne testified that the toolmarks in the barrel of the Hinton revolver had been corroded away so that it would be impossible to say with certainty whether a particular bullet had been fired from that gun. He also testified that the bullets from the three crime scenes did not match one another. The State's two experts, by contrast, maintained that all six bullets had indeed been fired from the Hinton revolver. On cross-examination, the badly discredited Payne. Payne admitted that he'd testified as an expert on firearms and toolmark identification just twice in the preceding eight years and that one of the two cases involved a shotgun rather than a handgun. Payne also conceded that he had had difficulty operating the microscope at the state forensic laboratory and had asked for help from one of the state experts. The ended the cross-examination with this colloquy: QUOTED TEXT QUOTED TEXT QUOTED TEXT QUOTED TEXT Tr. The 's closing argument highlighted the fact that Payne's expertise was in military ordnance, not firearms and toolmark identification, and that Payne had graduated in (more than half a century before the with a degree in civil engineering, whereas the State's experts had years of training and experience in the field of firearms and toolmark examination. The said: QUOTED TEXT WL (Cobb, J., dissenting) (quoting Tr. ). The convicted Hinton and recommended by a -to vote that he be to death. The accepted that recommendation and imposed a death In his state postconviction petition, Hinton contended that his was QUOTED TEXT WL To show that he had been prejudiced by Payne's ineffective Hinton produced three new experts on toolmark evidence. One of the three, a forensic consultant named John Dillon, had worked on toolmark identification at the Federal Bureau of Investigation's forensics laboratory and, from until he retired in had served as chief of the firearms and toolmark unit at the FBI's headquarters. The other two postconviction experts had worked for many years as firearms and toolmark examiners at the Dallas County Crime Laboratory and had each testified as toolmark experts in several hundred cases. All three experts examined the physical evidence and testified that they could not conclude that any of the six bullets had been fired from the Hinton revolver. The State did not submit rebuttal evidence during the postconviction hearing, and one of Hinton's experts testified that, pursuant to the ethics code of his trade organization, the Association of Firearm and Tool Mark Examiners, he had asked the State's expert, Yates, to show him how he had determined that the recovered bullets had been fired from the Hinton revolver. Yates refused to cooperate. The court denied Hinton's postconviction petition on the ground that Hinton had not been prejudiced by Payne's allegedly poor performance because Payne's did not depart from what Hinton's postconviction experts had said: The bullets could not be affirmatively matched either to one another or to the Hinton revolver. The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed by a -to vote. The court agreed with the court that Hinton had not been prejudiced because Payne's if believed by the strongly supported the inference that Hinton was innocent. Then- Cobb (who later became chief justice of the Alabama dissented.

The was thus focused on Payne's own qualifications, rather than on whether a better expert one who could have been hired had the learned that there was no funding cap and requested additional funds would have made a more compelling case for Hinton. On the court held that Payne was indeed qualified to as a firearms and toolmark expert under the Alabama evidentiary standard in place at the time of the which required only that Payne have had QUOTED TEXT WL (Alabama Criminal Application, Dec. ); see also Charles versus State, Southern Reporterthern Reporter (Alabama Criminal Application (QUOTED TEXT).

Hinton then filed this petition for a of This case calls for a straightforward application of our ineffective-assistance-of- precedents, beginning with Strickland versus Washington, U.S. Strickland recognized that the Sixth Amendment's that QUOTED TEXT entails that s are entitled to be represented by an who meets at least a minimal standard of competence. Padilla versus Kentucky, U.S. (quoting Strickland, at ). A QUOTED TEXT Padilla, at (quoting Strickland, at ). Under that standard, it was unreasonable for Hinton's lawyer to fail to seek additional funds to hire an expert where that failure was based not on any strategic choice but on a mistaken belief that available funding was capped at QUOTED TEXT This was such a case. As Hinton's recognized, the core of the 's case was the state experts' conclusion that the six bullets had been fired from the Hinton revolver, and effectively rebutting that case required a competent expert on the defense side. Hinton's also recognized that Payne was not a good expert, at least with respect to toolmark evidence. Nonetheless, he felt he was QUOTED TEXT with Payne because he could not find a better expert willing to work for and he believed that he was unable to obtain more than to cover expert fees. As discussed above, that belief was wrong: Alabama law in effect beginning more than a year before Hinton was arrested provided for state reimbursement of QUOTED TEXT Alabama Code And the expressly invited Hinton's to file a request for further funds if he felt that more funding was necessary. Yet the did not seek further funding. The 's failure to request additional funding in to replace an expert he knew to be inadequate because he mistakenly believed that he had received all he could get under Alabama law constituted deficient performance. Hinton's knew that he needed more funding to present an effective defense, yet he failed to make even the cursory investigation of the state providing for defense funding for indigent s that would have revealed to him that he could receive reimbursement not just for but for QUOTED TEXT An 's ignorance of a point of law that is fundamental to his case combined with his failure to perform basic research on that point is a quintessential example of unreasonable performance under Strickland. See, e.g., Williams versus Taylor, U.S. (finding deficient performance where QUOTED TEXT); Kimmelman versus Morrison, U.S. (finding deficient performance where failed to conduct pre and that failure QUOTED TEXT). We wish to be clear that the inadequate assistance of we find in this case does not consist of the hiring of an expert who, though qualified, was not qualified enough. The selection of an expert is a paradigmatic example of the type of QUOTED TEXT that, when made QUOTED TEXT is QUOTED TEXT Strickland, U.S. at We do not today launch federal courts into examination of the relative qualifications of experts hired and experts that might have been hired. The only inadequate assistance of here was the inexcusable mistake of law the unreasonable failure to understand the resources that state law made available to him that caused to employ an expert that he himself deemed inadequate. Having established deficient performance, Hinton must also QUOTED TEXT Id., at QUOTED TEXT The Court of Criminal Appeals held, and the State contends in its in opposition to that Hinton could not have been prejudiced by his 's use of Payne rather than a more qualified expert because Payne said all that Hinton could have hoped for from a toolmark expert: that the bullets used in the crimes could nothave been fired from the Hinton revolver. See WL (QUOTED TEXT). It is true that Payne's would have done Hinton a lot of good if the had believed it. But the did not believe Payne. And if there is a reasonable probability that Hinton's would have hired an expert who would have instilled in the a reasonable doubt as to Hinton's guilt had the known that the statutory funding limit had been lifted, then Hinton was prejudiced by his lawyer's deficient performance and is entitled to a new That the State presented from two experienced expert es that tended to inculpate Hinton does not, taken alone, demonstrate that Hinton is experts, of course, can sometimes make mistakes. Indeed, we have recognized the threat to fair criminal s posed by the potential for incompetent or fraudulent forensics experts, noting that QUOTED TEXT Melendez-Diaz versus Massachusetts, U.S. (citing Garrett Neufeld, Invalid Forensic Science and Wrongful Convictions, irginia Law Review )). This threat is minimized when the defense retains a competent expert to counter the of the 's expert es; it is maximized when the defense instead fails to understand the resources available to it by law.

case-567-37,unknown," In this habeas case, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth set aside two -year-old murder s based on the flimsiest of rationales. The court's decision is a textbook example of what the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Act of (AEDPA) proscribes: QUOTED TEXT Renico versus Lett, U.S. (slip opinion, at ). We therefore grant the petition for and reverse. I Between and a.m. on the morning of June , David Eugene Matthews broke into the Louisville home he had until recently shared with his estranged wife, Mary Marlene Matthews (Marlene). At the time, Matthews' mother-in-law, Magdalene Cruse, was staying at the home with her daughter. Matthews found Cruse in bed and shot her in the head at point-blank range, using a gun he had purchased with borrowed funds hours before. Matthews left Cruse there mortally wounded and went into the next room, where he found his wife. He had sexual relations with her once or twice; stayed with her until about a.m.; and then shot her twice, killing her. Cruse would die from her wound later that day. Matthews was apprehended that morning at his mother's house, where he had already begun to wash the clothes he wore during the crime. Later in the day, police officers found the murder weapon secreted below the floorboards of a backyard shed on the At the police station, Matthews made a tape-recorded statement to a police detective in which he denied responsibility for the murders. A grand indicted Matthews for the two murders and for At he did not contest that he killed the two victims. Instead, he sought to show that he had acted under QUOTED TEXT which under Kentucky law serves to reduce a homicide that would otherwise be murder to first-degree As support for that Matthews pointed to the troubled history of his marriage with Marlene. Matthews and his wife had been frequently separated from one another, and their periods of separation were marked by extreme hostility. Marlene would regularly procure criminal s against Matthews; several weeks before the murders she obtained one charging Matthews with sexual abuse of Marlene's -year-old daughter, which had led to Matthews' spending roughly three weeks in jail. Witnesses also testified that Marlene sought to control Matthews when they were together and would yell at him from across the street when they were separated; and Matthews' mother recounted that Marlene would leave the couple's young child crying in the street late at night outside the house where Matthews was sleeping in to antagonize him. Matthews also introduced the of a psychiatrist, Dr. Lee Chutkow, who had evaluated Matthews. Dr. Chutkow related what Matthews had told him about the murders, including that Matthews had been drinking heavily and taking alium and a stimulant drug. Dr. Chutkow testified that he had diagnosed Matthews as suffering from an adjustment dis which he described as a QUOTED TEXT that would temporarily impair a person's judgment and cause symptoms such as QUOTED TEXT Record Dr. Chutkow testified to his opinion that Matthews was acting under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance at the time of the murders in particular, that he experienced QUOTED TEXT id., at whom he perceived as having tormented and emasculated him. The convicted Matthews on all charges, and he was to death. The Kentucky affirmed the s and rejecting Matthews' s of error. In response to Matthews' argument that the evidence was insufficient to establish that he had acted in the absence of extreme emotional disturbance, the court concluded that the evidence regarding Matthews' QUOTED TEXT Id., at A that the had committed during his closing argument was rejected on the merits, but without discussion. Following an unsuccessful state post proceeding, Matthews filed a petition for a of habeas under U.S.C. in the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky. Matthews contended, among other things, that the Kentucky had contravened clearly established federal law in rejecting his that the evidence was insufficient to prove that he had not acted under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance and in rejecting his of ial The District Court dismissed the petition, but a divided of the Sixth reversed with instructions to grant relief. Federal ).Under AEDPA, the Sixth had no authority to issue the of habeas unless the Kentucky 's decision QUOTED TEXT or QUOTED TEXT U.S.C. The Sixth gave two grounds for its conclusion that Matthews was entitled to relief under this QUOTED TEXT Cullen versus Pinholster, U.S. (slip opinion, at (internal quotation marks omitted). Neither is valid. A First, the Sixth held that the Kentucky had impermissibly shifted to Matthews the burden of proving extreme emotional disturbance, and that the Commonwealth had failed to prove the absence of extreme emotional disturbance beyond a reasonable doubt. The Sixth reasoned that, at the time Matthews committed his offenses, the allocation of the burden of proof on extreme emotional disturbance was governed by the Kentucky 's decision in Gall versus Commonwealth, S.W. ), which placed the burden of producing evidence on the but left the burden of proving the absence of extreme emotional disturbance with the Commonwealth in those cases in which the had introduced evidence sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt on the issue. According to the Sixth however, the Kentucky departed from that understanding in Matthews' case and placed the burden of proving extreme emotional disturbance QUOTED TEXT Federal d, at The Sixth 's interpretation is supported by certain aspects of the Kentucky 's opinion in Matthews' case. For example, the state court indicated that Matthews had QUOTED TEXT of his extreme emotional disturbance, yet the court rejected his sufficiency-of-the-evidence by finding the evidence he had presented QUOTED TEXT rather than by stating that it failed to raise a reasonable doubt. The state court also observed that it had recently clarified in Wellman versus Commonwealth, S.W. ), In the Sixth 's view, the Kentucky 's reliance on this Wellman formulation of extreme emotional disturbance in resolving Matthews' violated the Due Process as construed by this Court in Bouie versus City of Columbia, U.S. because it involved the retroactive application of an QUOTED TEXT judicial revision of the Kentucky murder The Kentucky 's initial assessment of the evidence and reliance upon Wellman would be relevant if they formed the sole basis for denial of Matthews' sufficiency-of-the-evidence It is not clear, however, that they did. The Kentucky explained that QUOTED TEXT S.W. d, at Those instructions required the to find beyond a reasonable doubt that Matthews had not acted QUOTED TEXT Record The case had been submitted to the with the burden assigned to the Commonwealth, the had found that burden carried, and the Kentucky found the evidence adequate to sustain that finding. That ground was sufficient to reject Matthews' so it is irrelevant that the court also invoked a ground of questionable validity. See Wetzel versus Lambert, U.S. (per curiam) (slip opinion, at ). The Sixth 's opinion also challenges the conclusion that the evidence supported a finding of no extreme emotional disturbance. We have said that QUOTED TEXT Cavazos versus Smith, U.S. (per curiam) (slip opinion, at ). The evidence is sufficient to support a whenever, QUOTED TEXT Jackson versus irginia, U.S. And a state-court decision rejecting a sufficiency challenge may not be overturned on federal habeas unless the QUOTED TEXT Cavazos, at (slip opinion, at ). In light of this twice-deferential standard, it is abundantly clear that the Kentucky 's rejection of Matthews' sufficiency is controlling in this federal habeas proceeding. The Sixth noted that Dr. Chutkow expressed an opinion that Matthews was under the influence of extreme emotional disturbance at the time of the murders, and did not retreat from that opinion on cross-examination. But there was ample evidence pointing in the other direction as well. As the Kentucky observed, Matthews' of extreme emotional disturbance was belied by QUOTED TEXT S.W. d, at -including the facts that he borrowed money to purchase the murder weapon the day of the murders, that he waited several hours after buying the gun before starting for his wife's home, and that he delayed several hours between shooting his mother-in-law and killing his wife. The was also belied by his behavior after the murders, including his QUOTED TEXT and later QUOTED TEXT Ibid. The Sixth discounted this evidence because Dr. Chutkow testified that Matthews' deliberateness and consciousness of wrongdoing were not inconsistent with the diagnosis of extreme emotional disturbance. But expert does not trigger a conclusive presumption of correctness, and it was not unreasonable to conclude that the jurors were entitled to consider the tension between Dr. Chutkow's and their own common-sense understanding of emotional disturbance. In resolving the conflict in favor of Dr. Chutkow's the Sixth overstepped the proper limits of its authority. See Jackson, at More fundamentally, the Sixth did not appear to consider the possibility that the could have found the symptoms described by Dr. Chutkow inadequate to establish what is required to reduce murder to under Kentucky law: that Matthews QUOTED TEXT Kentucky Review Annotation . Dr. Chutkow himself agreed that many people face tension and anxiety two symptoms he attributed to Matthews. And he agreed that many people suffer from adjustment dis s. But of course very few people commit murders. In light of these points, which bear on the proper characterization of Matthews' mental condition and the reasonableness of his conduct, the Kentucky made no objectively unreasonable error in concluding that the question of extreme emotional disturbance was properly committed to the for As a second ground for its decision, the Sixth held that certain remarks made by the during his closing argument constituted a denial of due process. This was rejected on the merits by the Kentucky (albeit without analysis) and therefore receives deferential review under the AEDPA standard. See Harrington versus Richter, U.S. (slip opinion, at ). The QUOTED TEXT relevant here is our decision in Darden versus Wainwright, U.S. which explained that a 's improper comments will be held to violate the Constitution only if they QUOTED TEXT Id., at (quoting Donnelly versus DeChristoforo, U.S. ). According to the Sixth the violated Darden by suggesting that Matthews had colluded with his lawyer, David Busse, and with Dr. Chutkow to manufacture an extreme emotional disturbance defense. But although the Sixth quoted a lengthy section of the 's closing argument which could be understood as raising a charge of collusion, the court did not address the 's statement that immediately followed the quoted portion and expressly disavowed any suggestion of collusion: QUOTED TEXT Record With the 's immediate clarification that he was not alleging collusion in view, the Sixth 's conclusion that this feature of the closing argument clearly violated due process is unsupportable. Nor does the 's suggestion that Matthews had QUOTED TEXT ibid., suffice to justify the Sixth 's grant of habeas relief. In context, that statement is clearly a part of a broader argument that Matthews had a to exaggerate his emotional disturbance in his meetings with Dr. Chutkow. Shortly after the quoted statement, the continued with a series of rhetorical questions: QUOTED TEXT Ibid. The Sixth cited no of this Court in support of its conclusion that due process prohibits a from emphasizing a criminal 's to exaggerate exculpatory facts. The Sixth also suggested that the QUOTED TEXT Federal d, at by stating that QUOTED TEXT Record But the Kentucky could have understood this comment too as having been directed at Matthews' to exaggerate his emotional disturbance i.e., as emphasizing that the unavailability of any other defense raised the stakes with respect to extreme emotional disturbance. Moreover, even if the comment is understood as directing the 's attention to inappropriate considerations, that would not establish that the Kentucky 's rejection of the Darden ial QUOTED TEXT Harrington, U.S. at (slip opinion, at ). Indeed, Darden itself held that a closing argument considerably more inflammatory than the one at issue here did not habeas relief. See U.S. at n. referred to the as an QUOTED TEXT); id., at n. (QUOTED TEXT). Particularly because the Darden standard is a very general one, leaving courts QUOTED TEXT Yarborough versus Alvarado, U.S. ), the Sixth had no to set aside the Kentucky 's conclusion. The Sixth also erred by consulting its own s, rather than those of this Court, in assessing the reasonableness of the Kentucky 's decision. After quoting the governing standard from our decision in Darden, the Sixth added that it would QUOTED TEXT Federal d, at (quoting Broom versus Mitchell, Federal (CA6 )). It went on to evaluate the flagrancy step of that inquiry in light of four factors derived from its own QUOTED TEXT Federal d, at (quoting Broom, at ). And it stated that QUOTED TEXT certain comments held unconstitutional in its prior decision in Gall Federal (CA6 ), QUOTED TEXT Federal d, at As we explained in correcting an identical error by the Sixth two Terms ago, see Renico, U.S. at (slip opinion, at ), does not constitute QUOTED TEXT U.S.C. ). It therefore cannot form the basis for habeas relief under AEDPA. Nor can the Sixth 's reliance on its own s be defended in this case on the ground that they merely reflect what has been QUOTED TEXT by our cases. The highly generalized standard for evaluating s of ial set forth in Darden bears scant resemblance to the elaborate, multistep test employed by the Sixth here. To make matters worse, the Sixth decided Gallunder pre-AEDPA law, see Federal d, at n. so that case did not even purport to reflect clearly established law as set out in this Court's holdings. It was plain and repetitive error for the Sixth to rely on its own s in granting Matthews habeas relief. The petition for a of and 's motion to proceed in forma pauperis are granted. The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. It is so ed. Notes An ambiguously worded in the Sixth 's opinion, see Federal , n. ), suggests that the court may have found an additional due process violation. The court referred to a statement in the Kentucky 's decision in Gall versus Commonwealth S.W. ), that QUOTED TEXT Relying on its own opinion in Gall's federal habeas proceeding, Gall versus Parker, Federal (CA6 (Gall ), the Sixth suggested that the quoted statement QUOTED TEXT Federal d, at n. in violation of this Court's decision in Mullaney versus Wilbur, That is not so. The statement explicitly acknowledges that the burden of proof rests with the but merely asserts that when the burden of production is assigned to the the may find the 's burden of proof satisfied without introduction of negating evidence, unless the 's evidence is so probative as to establish reasonable doubt as a matter of law. That seems to us a truism. See J. Strong, McCormick on Evidence pages th edition ). Our opinion in Mullaney addressed a situation in which the burden of persuasion was shifted to the see U.S. at and n. it does not remotely show that the Kentucky 's truism contravened clearly established federal law.

Contrary to the state post court, we conclude that the 's failure to disclose material evidence violated Wearry's due process rights. We reverse the state post court's judgment on that account, and therefore do not reach Wearry's ineffective-assistance-of- A Sometime between and on the evening of April , Eric Walber was brutally murdered. Nearly two years after the murder, Sam Scott, at the time incarcerated, contacted authorities and implicated Michael Wearry. Scott initially reported that he had been friends withthe victim; that he was at work the night of the murder; that the victim had come looking for him but had instead run into Wearry and four others; and that Wearry and the others had later confessed to shooting and driving over the victim before leaving his body on Blahut Road. In fact, the victim had not been shot, and his body had been found on Crisp Road. Scott changed his account of the crime over the course of four later statements, each of which differed from the others in material ways. By the time Scott testified as the State's star at Wearry's his story bore little resemblance to his original account. According to the version Scott told the he had been playing dice with Wearry and others when the victim drove past. Wearry, who had been losing, decided to rob the victim. After Wearry and an acquaintance, Randy Hutchinson, stopped the victim's car, Hutchinson shoved the victim into the cargo area. Five men, including Scott, Hutchinson, and Wearry, proceeded to drive around, at one point encountering Eric Brown the State's other main and pausing in ittently to the victim. Finally, Scott related, Wearry and two others killed the victim by running him over. On cross-examination, Scott admitted that he had changed his account several times. Consistent with Scott's Brown testified that on the night of the murder he had seen Wearry and others with a man who looked like the victim. Incarcerated on unrelated charges at the time of Wearry's Brown acknowledged that he had made a prior inconsistent statement to the police, but had rec and agreed to against Wearry, not for any prosecutorial favor, but solely because his sister knew the victim's sister. The State commented during its opening argument that Brown QUOTED TEXT Record (Tr., Mar. ). During closing argument, the State reiterated that Brown QUOTED TEXT and was ing because the victim's QUOTED TEXT Petition for Although the State presented no physical evidence at it did additional linking Wearry to the victim. One testified that he saw Wearry in the victim's car on the night of the murder and, later, holding the victim's class ring. Another said he saw Wearry throwing away the victim's cologne. In some respects, however, these es contradicted Scott's account. For example, the who reported seeing Wearry in the victim's car did not place Scott in the car. Wearry's defense at rested on an He ed that, at the time of the murder, he had been at a wedding reception in Baton Rouge, miles away. Wearry's girlfriend, her sister, and her aunt corroborated Wearry's account. In closing argument, the State stressed that all three es had personal relationships with Wearry. The State also presented two rebuttal es: the bride at the wedding, who reported that the reception had ended by or (potentially leaving sufficient time for Wearry to have committed the crime); and three jail employees, who testified that they had overheard Wearry say that he was a bystander when the crime occurred.

Second, the State had failed to disclose that, contrary to the 's assertions at Brown had twice sought a deal to reduce his existing in exchange for ing against Wearry. The police had told Brown that they would QUOTED TEXT Petition for (quoting police notes). Third, the had failed to turn over medical records on Randy Hutchinson. According to Scott, on the night of the murder, Hutchinson had run into the street to flag down the victim, pulled the victim out of his car, shoved him into the cargo space, and crawled into the cargo space himself. But Hutchinson's medical records revealed that, nine days before the murder, Hutchinson had undergone knee surgery to repair a ruptured patellar tendon. An expert Dr. Paul Dworak, testified at the state review hearing that Hutchinson's surgically repaired knee could not have withstood running, bending, or lifting substantial weight. The State presented an expert who disagreed with Dr. Dworak's appraisal of Hutchinson's physical fitness. During state post proceedings, Wearry also maintained that his had failed to uncover exonerating evidence. Wearry's admitted at the state review hearing that he had conducted no independent investigation into Wearry's innocence and had relied solely on evidence the State and Wearry had provided. For example, despite Wearry's his undertook no effort to locate independent es from among the dozens of guests who had attended the wedding reception. representing Wearry on review conducted an independent investigation. This investigation revealed many es lacking any personal relationship with Wearry who would have been willing to corroborate his had they been called at review 's investigation also revealed that Scott's brother and sister-in-law would have been willing to at as they did at the review hearing, that Scott was with them, mostly at a strawberry festival, until around on the night of the murder.

The dissent asserts that, apart from the of Scott and Brown, there was independent evidence pointing to Wearry as the murderer. See post, at (opinion of Alito, J.). But all of the evidence the dissent cites suggests, at most, that someone in Wearry's group of friends may have committed the crime, and that Wearry may have been involved in events related to the murder after it occurred. Perhaps, on the basis of this evidence, Louisiana might have charged Wearry as an after the fact. Louisiana Review Annotation (West (providing a maximum prison of five years for accessories after the fact). But Louisiana instead charged Wearry with capital murder, and the only evidence directly tying him to that crime was Scott's dubious corroborated by the similarly suspect of Brown. As the dissent recognizes, QUOTED TEXT Post, at Scott's credibility, already impugned by his many inconsistent stories, would have been further diminished had the learned that Hutchinson may have been physically incapable of performing the role Scott ascribed to him, that Scott had coached another inmate to lie about the murder and thereby enhance his chances to get out of jail, or that Scott may have implicated Wearry to a personal score. Moreover, any who found Scott more credible in light of Brown's might have thought differently had she learned that Brown may have been motivated to come forward not by his sister's relationship with the victim's sister as the had insisted in its closing argument but by the possibility of a reduced on an existing See Napue, at (even though the State had made no binding promises, a attempt to obtain a deal before ing was material because the QUOTED TEXT). Even if the armed with all of this new evidence could have voted to convict Wearry, we have QUOTED TEXT Smith, at (slip opinion, at ). Reaching the opposite conclusion, the state post court improperly evaluated the materiality of each piece of evidence in isolation rather than cumulatively, see Kyles versus Whitley, U.S. (requiring a QUOTED TEXT of the materiality of wrongfully withheld evidence), emphasized reasons a might disregard new evidence while ignoring reasons she might not, compare Porter versus McCollum, U.S. (per curiam) (QUOTED TEXT just because the State's expert provided contrary ), and failed even to mention the statements of the two inmates impeaching Scott. In addition to defending the judgment of the Louisiana courts, the dissent criticizes the Court for deciding this QUOTED TEXT Post, at But the Court has not shied away from summarily deciding fact-intensive cases where, as here, lower courts have egregiously misapplied law. See, e.g., Mullenix versus Luna, at (percuriam); Stanton versus Sims, U.S. (per curiam); Parker versus Matthews, U.S. (per curiam); Because QUOTED TEXT the dissent continues, QUOTED TEXT when it was drafting its in opposition, that the Court might summarily reverse Wearry's Contrary to the dissent, however, summarily deciding a capital case, when circumstances so is hardly unprecedented. See Sears, at (vacating a state post court's denial of relief on a -phase ineffective-assistance-of- ); Porter, at provided ineffective assistance of by conducting a constitutionally inadequate investigation into mitigating evidence). Perhaps anticipating the possibility of summary reversal, the State devoted the bulk of its -page in opposition to a point-by-point rebuttal of Wearry's s. Given this as well as the State's lower court filings similarly concentrating on evidence supporting its position, the chances that further ing or argument would change the outcome are vanishingly slim. The dissent also inveighs against the Court's QUOTED TEXT Post, at This Court, of course, has over the final judgments of state post courts, see U.S.C. and exercises that in appropriate circumstances. Earlier this for instance, we heard argument in Foster versus Chatman, Number which involves the Georgia courts' denial of post relief to a capital raising a under Batson versus Kentucky, U.S. See also Smith, U.S. at (slip opinion, at (reversing a state post court's denial of relief on a Brady ); Reviewing the Louisiana courts' denial of post relief is thus hardly the bold departure the dissent paints it to be. The alternative to granting review, after all, is forcing Wearry to endure yet more time on Louisiana's death row in service of a that is constitutionally flawed. Because Wearry's due process rights were violated, we grant his petition for a of and motion for leave to proceed in forma pauperis, reverse the judgment of the Louisiana post court, and for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion. It is so ordered. Notes Wearry argued, inter alia, that the court improperly denied his for-cause challenges, and that the discriminated on the basis of race in selection in violation of Batson versus Kentucky, U.S. Finding both -selection s credible, then-Justice Johnson dissented from the affirmance of Wearry's (Wearry's name is misspelled in the direct- case caption.) Illustrative of the liberties the dissent takes with the record is the assertion that QUOTED TEXT Post, at (opinion of Alito, J.). Introducing the inmate's statement, the dissent therefore suggests, might have QUOTED TEXT Id., at True, according to the inmate, Scott had complained that his identification of Wearry had resulted in a lengthier prison The inmate, however, did not suggest that Scott was angry with Wearry because he had suffered adverse consequences as a result of Wearry's crime. Instead, the inmate separately stated that Scott QUOTED TEXT i.e., who killed Eric Walber-QUOTED TEXT Petition Exhibit in Number -FELN p. See also ibid. Scott's refusal to identify Wearry as the culprit while also endeavoring to QUOTED TEXT ibid. suggests that Wearry did not commit the crime, but Scott had decided to bring him down anyway. Nor, contrary to the dissent, is there any reason to believe that Scott anticipated his participation in this case would cost him additional years in prison. Notably, in the first of his five accounts to police, Scott reported that he had not been present at the time of the murder and had learned about it only after the fact. Indeed, it is at least as plausible as the dissent's hypothesis that Scott believed implicating Wearry might win him early on his existing The dissent emphasizes a State's that QUOTED TEXT Post, at (quoting Record (Tr., Mar. )). But from this statement, neither Wearry nor the had any way of knowing what the medical records would have revealed: Hutchinson had undergone a patellar-tendon repair rather than a routine procedure. Wearry's did ask the public defender's investigator to look into the backgrounds of the State's es and to speak with Wearry's family members. But the testified at the review hearing that he did not know what persons the investigator contacted and, in any event, he had serious doubts about the investigator's qualifications and competence. Moreover, there is no indication that the investigator ever engaged in inquiries regarding Scott's background or his whereabouts on the night of the murder.

case-577-14-1143,unknown," On the night of March , Sergeant Randy Baker of the Tulia, Texas Police Department followed Israel Leija, Jr., to a drive-in restaurant, with a for his When Baker approached Leija's car and informed him that he was under Leija sped off, headed for Interstate Baker gave chase and was quickly joined by Trooper Gabriel Rodriguez of the Texas Department of Public Safety Leija entered the interstate and led the officers on an -minute chase at speeds between and miles per hour. Twice during the chase, Leija called the Tulia Police dispatcher, claiming to have a gun and threatening to shoot at police officers if they did not abandon their pursuit. The dispatcher relayed Leija's threats, together with a report that Leija might be intoxicated, to all concerned officers. As Baker and Rodriguez maintained their pursuit, other law enforcement officers set up tire spikes at three locations. Officer Troy Ducheneaux of the Canyon Police Department manned the spike strip at the first location Leija was expected to reach, beneath the overpass at Cemetery Road. Ducheneaux and the other officers had received training on the deployment of spike strips, including on how to take a defensive position so as to minimize the risk posed by the passing driver. DPS Trooper Chadrin Mullenix also responded. He drove to the Cemetery Road overpass, initially intending to set up a spike strip there. Upon learning of the other spike strip positions, however, Mullenix began to consider another tactic: shooting at Leija's car in to disable it. Mullenix had not received training in this tactic and had not attempted it before, but he radioed the idea to Rodriguez. Rodriguez responded QUOTED TEXT gave Mullenix his position, and said that Leija had slowed to miles per hour. Mullenix then asked the DPS dispatcher to inform his supervisor, Sergeant Byrd, of his plan and ask if Byrd thought it was QUOTED TEXT Federal d, at Before Byrd's response, Mullenix exited his vehicle and, armed with his service rifle, took a shooting position on the overpass, feet above I Respondents allege that from this position, Mullenix still could hear Byrd's response to QUOTED TEXT and QUOTED TEXT Ibid. ]* As Mullenix waited for Leija to arrive, he and another officer, Randall County 's Deputy Tom Shipman, discussed whether Mullenix's plan would work and how and where to shoot the vehicle to best carry it out. Shipman also informed Mullenix that another officer was located beneath the overpass. Approximately three minutes after Mullenix took up his shooting position, he spotted Leija's vehicle, with Rodriguez in pursuit. As Leija approached the overpass, Mullenix fired six shots. Leija's car continued forward beneath the overpass, where it engaged the spike strip, hit the median, and rolled two and a half times. It was later determined that Leija had been killed by Mullenix's shots, four of which struck his upper body. There was no evidence that any of Mullenix's shots hit the car's radiator, hood, or engine block. Respondents sued Mullenix under Review U.S.C. alleging that he had violated the Fourth Amendment by using excessive force against Leija. Mullenix moved for summary judgment on the ground of qualified immunity, but the District Court denied his motion, finding that QUOTED TEXT WL Mullenix appealed, and the Court of Appeals for the Fifth affirmed. The court agreed with the District Court that the QUOTED TEXT Id., at King dissented. She described the QUOTED TEXT as QUOTED TEXT which, she noted, the has held QUOTED TEXT Id., at (quoting Scott versus Harris, U.S. , n. ). Turning to that legal question, King concluded that Mullenix's s were objectively reasonable. When Mullenix fired, she emphasized, he knew not only that Leija had threatened to shoot the officers involved in his pursuit, but also that Leija was seconds away from encountering such an officer beneath the overpass. King also dismissed the notion that Mullenix should have given the spike strips a chance to work. She explained that because spike strips are often ineffective, and because officers operating them are vulnerable to gunfire from passing cars, Mullenix reasonably feared that the officers manning them faced a significant risk of harm. Mullenix sought rehearing en banc before the Fifth but the court denied his petition. Jolly dissented, joined by six other members of the court. King, who joined Jolly's dissent, also filed a separate dissent of her own. On the same day, however, the two members forming the original 's majority withdrew their previous opinion and substituted a new one. The revised opinion recognized that objective unreasonableness is a question of law that can be resolved on summary judgment as King had explained in her dissent but reaffirmed the denial of qualified immunity. The majority concluded that Mullenix's s were objectively unreasonable because several of the factors that had justified deadly force in previous cases were absent here: There were no innocent bystanders, Leija's driving was relatively controlled, Mullenix had not first given the spike strips a chance to work, and Mullenix's decision was not a split-second judgment. The court went on to conclude that Mullenix was not entitled to qualified immunity because QUOTED TEXT Id., at We address only the qualified immunity question, not whether there was a Fourth Amendment violation in the first place, and now reverse. The doctrine of qualified immunity shields officials from civil so long as their conduct QUOTED TEXT Pearson versus Callahan, U.S. (quoting Harlow versus Fitzgerald, U.S. ).

This Court summarily reversed, holding that use of Garner's QUOTED TEXT test for excessive force was QUOTED TEXT Brosseau, U.S. at The correct inquiry, the Court explained, was whether it was clearly established that the Fourth Amendment prohibited the officer's conduct in the QUOTED TEXT Id., at The Court considered three court of appeals cases discussed by the parties, noted that QUOTED TEXT and concluded that the officer was entitled to qualified immunity because QUOTED TEXT Id., at (emphasis added). Anderson versus Creighton, U.S. is also instructive on the required degree of specificity. There, the lower court had denied qualified immunity based on the clearly established QUOTED TEXT Id., at This Court faulted that formulation for failing to address the actual question at issue: whether QUOTED TEXT Id., at Without answering that question, the Court explained, the conclusion that Anderson's search was objectively unreasonable did not QUOTED TEXT from and thus was not clearly established by the principle that less searches not supported by probable cause and exigent circumstances violate the Fourth Amendment. In this case, Mullenix confronted a reportedly intoxicated fugitive, set on avoiding capture through high-speed vehicular flight, who twice during his flight had threatened to shoot police officers, and who was moments away from encountering an officer at Cemetery Road. The relevant inquiry is whether existing placed the conclusion that Mullenix acted unreasonably in these circumstances QUOTED TEXT al-Kidd, at The general principle that deadly force requires a sufficient threat hardly settles this matter. See Pasco versus Knoblauch, Federal (CA5 (QUOTED TEXT). Far from clarifying the issue, excessive force cases involving car chases reveal the hazy legal backdrop against which Mullenix acted. In Brosseau itself, the Court held that an officer did not violate clearly established law when she shot a fleeing suspect out of fear that he endangered QUOTED TEXT QUOTED TEXT and QUOTED TEXT U.S. at (first alteration in original; internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis added). The threat Leija posed was at least as immediate as that presented by a suspect who had just begun to drive off and was headed only in the general direction of officers and bystanders. By the time Mullenix fired, Leija had led police on a -mile chase at extremely high speeds, was reportedly intoxicated, had twice threatened to shoot officers, and was racing towards an officer's location. This Court has considered excessive force claims in connection with high-speed chases on only two occasions since Brosseau. In Scott versus Harris, U.S. the Court held that an officer did not violate the Fourth Amendment by ramming the car of a fugitive whose reckless driving QUOTED TEXT Id., at And in Plumhoff versus Rickard, U.S. ), the Court reaffirmed Scott by holding that an officer acted reasonably when he fatally shot a fugitive who was QUOTED TEXT a chase that QUOTED TEXT U.S. at (slip opinion, at ). The Court has thus never found the use of deadly force in connection with a dangerous car chase to violate the Fourth Amendment, let alone to be a basis for denying qualified immunity. Leija in his flight did not pass as many cars as the drivers in Scott or Plumhoff; traffic was light on I At the same time, the fleeing fugitives in Scott and Plumhoff had not verbally threatened to kill any officers in their path, nor were they about to come upon such officers. Given Leija's conduct, we cannot say that only someone QUOTED TEXT or who QUOTED TEXT would have perceived a sufficient threat and acted as Mullenix did. The dissent focuses on the availability of spike strips as an alternative means of terminating the chase. It argues that even if Leija posed a threat sufficient to justify deadly force in some circumstances, Mullenix nevertheless contravened clearly established law because he did not wait to see if the spike strips would work before taking Spike strips, however, present dangers of their own, not only to drivers who encounter them at speeds between and miles per hour, but also to officers manning them. See, e.g., Thompson versus Mercer, Federal (CA5 ); for National Association of Police Organizations and others as Amici Curiae Nor are spike strips always successful in ending the chase. See, e.g., Cordova versus Aragon, Federal (CA10 ); for National Association of Police Organizations and others as Amici Curiae (citing examples). The dissent can cite no case from this Court denying qualified immunity because officers entitled to terminate a high-speed chase selected one dangerous alternative over another. Even so, the dissent argues, there was no governmental interest that justified acting before Leija's car hit the spikes. Mullenix explained, however, that he feared Leija might attempt to shoot at or run over the officers manning the spike strips. Mullenix also feared that even if Leija hit the spike strips, he might still be able to continue driving in the direction of other officers. The dissent ignores these interests by suggesting that there was no QUOTED TEXT Post, at (opinion of Sotomayor, J.). In fact, Mullenix hoped his s would stop the car in a manner that avoided the risks to other officers and other drivers that relying on spike strips would entail. The dissent disputes the merits of the options available to Mullenix, post, at but others with more experience analyze the issues differently. See, e.g., for National Association of Police Organizations and others as Amici Curiae Ultimately, whatever can be said of the wisdom of Mullenix's choice, this Court's s do not place the conclusion that he acted unreasonably in these circumstances QUOTED TEXT al-Kidd, U.S. at More fundamentally, the dissent repeats the Fifth 's error. It defines the qualified immunity inquiry at a high level of generality whether any governmental interest justified choosing one tactic over another and then fails to consider that question in QUOTED TEXT Brosseau versus Haugen, U.S. at (internal quotation marks omitted). As in Anderson, the conclusion that Mullenix's reasons were insufficient to justify his s simply does not QUOTED TEXT from the general proposition that force must be justified. Cases decided by the lower courts since Brosseau likewise have not clearly established that deadly force is inappropriate in response to conduct like Leija's. The Fifth here principally relied on its own decision in Lytle versus Bexar County, Federal ), denying qualified immunity to a police officer who had fired at a fleeing car and killed one of its passengers. That holding turned on the court's assumption, for purposes of summary judgment, that the car was moving away from the officer and had already traveled some distance at the moment the officer fired. See id., at The court held that a reasonable could conclude that a receding car QUOTED TEXT Id., at But, crucially, the court also recognized that if the facts were as the officer alleged, and he fired as the car was coming towards him, QUOTED TEXT based on the QUOTED TEXT Id., at Without implying that Lytle was either correct or incorrect, it suffices to say that Lytle does not clearly dictate the conclusion that Mullenix was unjustified in perceiving grave danger and responding given that Leija was speeding towards a confrontation with officers he had threatened to kill. Cases that the Fifth ignored also suggest that Mullenix's assessment of the threat Leija posed was reasonable. In Long versus Slaton, Federal ), for example, the Eleventh held that a 's deputy did not violate the Fourth Amendment by fatally shooting a mentally unstable individual who was attempting to flee in the deputy's car, even though at the time of the shooting the individual had not yet operated the cruiser dangerously. The court explained that QUOTED TEXT and concluded that the deputy had reason to believe Long was dangerous based on his unstable state of mind, of the cruiser, and failure to heed the deputy's warning to stop. The court also rejected the notion that the deputy should have first tried less lethal methods, such as spike strips. the court held, QUOTED TEXT Id., at (alteration and internal quotation marks omitted). But see Smith versus Cupp, Federal (CA6 (denying qualified immunity to an officer who shot an intoxicated suspect who had stolen the officer's cruiser where a reasonable could have concluded that the suspect's flight did not immediately threaten the officer or any other bystander). Other cases cited by the Fifth and respondents are simply too factually distinct to speak clearly to the specific circumstances here. Several involve suspects who may have done little more than flee at relatively low speeds. See, e.g., Walker versus Davis, Federal (CA6 ); Kirby versus Duva, Federal (CA6 ); Adams versus Speers, Federal (CA9 ); aughan versus Cox, Federal and n. (CA11 ). These cases shed little light on whether the far greater danger of a speeding fugitive threatening to kill police officers waiting in his path could deadly force. The court below noted that QUOTED TEXT Federal d, at but surely in these circumstances the police were justified in taking Leija at his word when he twice told the dispatcher he had a gun and was prepared to use it. Finally, respondents argue that the danger Leija represented was less substantial than the threats that courts have found sufficient to justify deadly force. But the mere fact that courts have approved deadly force in more extreme circumstances says little, if anything, about whether such force was reasonable in the circumstances here. The fact is that when Mullenix fired, he reasonably understood Leija to be a fugitive fleeing at speeds over miles per hour, who was armed and possibly intoxicated, who had threatened to kill any officer he saw if the police did not abandon their pursuit, and who was racing towards Officer Ducheneaux's position. Even accepting that these circumstances fall somewhere between the two sets of cases respondents discuss, qualified immunity protects s in the QUOTED TEXT Brosseau, at (quoting Saucier, U.S. at some internal quotation marks omitted). Because the constitutional rule applied by the Fifth was not QUOTED TEXT Stanton versus Sims, U.S. (per curiam) (slip opinion, at ), we grant Mullenix's petition for and reverse the Fifth 's that Mullenix is not entitled to qualified immunity. It is so ed. Although Mullenix disputes hearing Byrd's response, we view the facts in the light most favorable to respondents, who oppose Mullenix's motion for summary judgment.
